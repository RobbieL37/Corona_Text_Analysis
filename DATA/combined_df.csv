After a couple months satisfaction and no problems I purchased 2 more to install in the other bathrooms. I would disagree with a few of the comments of having to flush twice, I have not had this trouble. The flush seems powerful to flush everything down so I'm not sure if they are commenting on the wrong toilet or maybe they don't have very high water pressure.......idk.

I purchased 2 and both have had issues with running continuously. First one about a year ago made some adjustments to the one and it sometimes leaks but not as often as the other. We actually received a message from our town about excessive water usage. We Used 120 thousand gallons of water in 6 months. They said it was likely a faulty toilet and they were absolutely correct. That is absolutely crazy 120k gallons . I made the same adjustments to the float which worked for a bit but now It is leaking again. These toilets have cost well more over time than you could imagine.

I had purchased a heavy duty wax ring but ended up returning it as the one that came with the toilet was more than sufficient. I am very happy with this purchase. I have experienced none of the problems reported on other reviews. The toilet flushes well and once is all that is needed.

( old toilet refill time was 90 seconds so I am definitely saving a lot of water.) Here is the interesting part. I bought a Champion 4 for our master bath.

I looked in the Mainstream tank and there is extremely hard to see text imprinted in ceramic saying the same thing. ( I had to take a sharpie and fill in the letters to read it) - Conclusion as shipped from factory Float valve needs to be adjusted - it does not come pre calibrated. Also unit works just fine with float set 1/2 way between as shipped and recommended setting. So if having flush power issues check the float valve height. as I have mentioned the Champion 4 what do you get for the extra $70 ( over mainstream) A. the oval bowl, B tool free installation hardware - 2 plastic handles are shipped with the tank nuts, the tank bolts are pre installed in better rubber grommets. The base to flange bolts have screw down lips that hold them in place during installation, and base to flange nuts have plastic over molds. - Oh and printing in the tank. c.

I knew I would need one but totally forgot. Installation was a breeze as with any other toilet you would purchase. A couple of things I'm on the edge with, to get a full flush you have to hold the handle, I'm not used to that so this is a curve on my side. It does fill quick, get's all the waste down in one flush. I was concerned about that after reading the prior reviews. I do love the height, yes it makes a difference when you have bad knees.

I was needing a new toilet and was looking for one that took up less space and used less water. The flush is way more quiet than my old toilet and the tank obviously is quicker to fill up since it uses less water. I'm short and tend to be vertically challenged. It wasn't an issue to buy the comfort height toilet. I'm use to sitting on higher toilets. But the toilet seat I have an issue with and that's why I give this 4 stars. I had read previous reviews where people said they didn't use the toilet seat that came with the box but none had really elaborated as to why. Well, I will. The seat has a very small opening which measures 8-1/2x10. So, when you sit down your bum feels like it's being suctioned through the opening. Then there's the angle to the seat where it curves inward. Hence, my feet dangle and I can't sit comfortably on the toilet and then I tend to urinate over my bum which usually isn't an issue. This princess doesn't like wetting herself and will be replacing the seat with a flatter more wide seat to avoid this over spray. Which could've been avoided from the beginning if other reviewers had just be so kind enough to disclose this little tidbit. No one likes to be awakened from their half asleep slumber in the middle of the night to fully wipe themselves dry and make sure they did it properly.

That includes a new toilet to replace the old elongated biscuit toilet that used 2+ gallons of water. I did my research and I concluded that this was what I needed. Well, I got it in and it works wonderfully. It flushed everything for the most part. It's not like a regular toilet where the water swirls around the toilet bowl and it flushes. I believe it flushes from the front. That is where the water savings comes in. I replaced the bolt caps with brushed nickel, since the ones that came with it are white. Also, the toilet seat is rather cheaply made, but I bought a nickel brushed hinge toilet seat that is slow close and that fixed that problem. It works nice. You may everyone once and a while have to use two flushes for those more than heavy moments and when too much toilet paper is used, but it handles it. But I do believe you have to have an opening of at least 3-4 inches on the waste opening for it to work right. Me, I had to install a toilet special toilet flange to connect to a cast iron pipe, but so far it works great. I also replaced the flush handle with a brushed nickel toilet handle, since the one that came with it was white. If anything that is a negative comes up, besides the seat, I will put in on here.To help with installation remember, you have to 12 inches from the wall to the edge of the tank for it to fit. As I mentioned, you also have to have a big enough opening for the waste which should be standard. Also if you like all white, go for it; otherwise, you will have to replace the handle, caps and seat. If any questions are needed on this, pleas ask. I will help where I can.",5,22.0,1.0

I hate it. #3~It (the commode) rocked after it was installed and the installer said my floor was not level and I used a wedge under it. It still wasn't stationery. #4~We go to ISTALLER number 2 and he redid the whole job of installing again last week, 7-25. He assured me the problem was not the first installer, but it was how the bottom of the commode was designed. He had to trim or adjust my pipe coming out of the floor, consuming a lot of time, and finally got it to stay solid and not rock. He said he had never seen a commode bottom made like that one. #5~One night I flushed before going to bed and the commode flush ran all night long. I am on well water and septic tank and my yard around the septic tank was flooded the next morning. Glad I have had a lot of rain lately or my well would have been near drained.

Compact tank size will work in any size bathroom. Everything is included but the water line to the wall. I sugest using a braded steal line so there is no chance of it bursting and flooding your house one day. Also the upper tank bolt kit that comes with this is cheap and only has a rubber washer for the topside. I would sugest using Brass bolts with a rubber washer on the top and botton of the tank and metal washers ontop of those to insure a long long lasting bolt and seal that will not couse leaks and issues in a few years. Brass bolts also handle intank cleaners or deodorizers much better then the cheap standard bolts that they included. So get a 7-8in Braided steel line and two brass bolts/nuts with 4 rubber washers and 4 steel washers, caulk for the floor and your ready to install. The tank kit is already set up and tightened. Since this is a low flow I would set the float to the highest setting for handling any load. A great wax ring is included along with a basic seat.",4,5.0,0.0

It does save water, which is great. The seat is cheapo and uncomfortable, no doubt about it. So is the seal. My plumber went the extra yard and got a better seal. The biggest problem is the flushes are inconsistent. About every 20th flush, the flapper gets caught on the chain and doesn't drop over the hole, causing the water to keep running and running, right down the drain. So much for the water savings, if I don't notice it right away. Consequently, I now have to stand there after every flush and tap the handle after the flush completes to make sure the flapper dropped. That is even after the pull chain length was adjusted to be taut and as short as possible. The chain's design is a bad thing. And about every 50th flush, the darn toilet just decides it doesn't want to completely flush. I have to dump a bucket of water into the bowl to trigger the siphoning action, and thankfully, that always works. It flushes fine after that --until the next time it's tired of flushing. I've never had to plunge it. Unlike other reviewers, I don't usually have trouble with stuff sticking to the sides, thankfully. As for the ""comfort height"", I debated whether I wanted that, since I'm only 5'2"". It is a bit easier to sit down, but my feet don't completely reach the floor, and it makes it less comfortable if I have to sit there a couple minutes. You're going to have this toilet for a while. You can do better than this one. Wish I had. You get what you pay for. My prior 60-year old American Standard pink toilet that I replaced with this one was much more reliable than this one.

They were easy to install. The innards of the tank come pre-assembled so all you have to do it put the base on the flange, secure it, attach the tank to the base, and then connect the water line. These toilets are supposed to resist stains more than other toilets because of the coating on the bowl. Honestly, I see no difference between how often I have to clean these toilets and how often I had to clean my old ones. However, I did have to invest in a different toilet brush. I had a regular one that I was using and it was not sufficient. It couldn't reach down into the recesses of the bowl to clean the hole where the water comes in and the hole where the water is flushed down. I bought a Scotch Brite toilet scrubber kit and the flexibility of the scrubber, as well as the shape is perfect for this toilet. I would definitely recommend switching if you get this toilet.",5,2.0,0.0

The plastic seat was so cheap and the hardware was also cheap plastic so the seat never stayed secure. Now the trip lever has broken with the cheap plastic breaking off inside the handle. And Lowes sell this model but does not carry replacement parts. Really. This is a Lowe's excluse. Had high hope for this (and it was more expensive when I bought it but so disappointed.

American Standard toilet that was ready for retirement. We have a 1950s-era 3-bedroom ranch house. It was installed in early January 2018, so we've had about 2 months' service from it. In most respects, it's a great toilet. The flushing mechanism does an amazing job of moving waste out of the bowl with very little water, and with about 99% first-flush reliability. I've only had to plunge the toilet twice, and both were easy jobs. Having said all of the above, if we had it to do all over again, I would probably look for a different toilet for this particular bathroom. Reason: this toilet has three inherent ""ick"" problems. I think it'd be a great option for bathrooms in out-of-the-way places, like a furnished basement, or places where a high standard of cleanliness isn't really expected, like an outbuilding or a lake cabin. But for a high-traffic area in your home, such as a half bathroom (aka a ""powder room"") in your downstairs living area, this is probably not a great choice. Here are the three ""ick factors"" I mentioned -- read at your own risk... The small amount of water in the bowl means that poo can pile up so high that some of it rises above the water line, and really puts a stink to the air. The small amount of water that enters the bowl is not enough to really flush the walls of the bowl and get them clean. So poo that gets on the wall of the bowl has to be brushed away. The small amount of water that enters the bowl is not enough to completely flush away ALL remnants of the previous bowl's ""load."" So, to keep the toilet looking presentable, it sometimes has to be flushed twice. Needless to say, this works against the water conservation ideal that the toilet is supposed to promote.",3,4.0,0.0

The unit comes complete with all the components you will most likely need for installation unless you want/need to change the hose or shutoff valve. Highlights: Instructions, if needed, are clear. Quiet flush. Strong flush - evacuates all waste, even with such low water usage. Higher seat height is wonderful (comfort height). I am 6' tall, my wife and SIL are 5'8"". The standing water in the bowl is plenty high to allow solid waste to wash out. Easy float adjustment. Low lights: If you are are a short-legged person, you may not like this higher-than-standard seat height. I would prefer a seat with a gentler radius on the edge under the thigh area.

Sometimes you need to flush a few times or use a toilet brush often, to get the bowl clean. I need to find a grommet or bushing to restrict the water coming out of the jet and force it into the rim holes; that might fix the problem. Otherwise, I need a new toilet.

To be fair, I may have gotten a ""lemon."" The water level in the bowl kept sinking and was not fixable via a water ""adjustment"" inside the tank. By the way, there was no detectable water level line inscribed the tank so it was a pure guessing game as to what level it should be. Two weeks later, water eventually leaked from the based through the caulking. I replaced the wax ring with a heavy duty model, but the leak persisted. There was clearly a crack or other defect inside. Even if everything worked perfectly, I still would not recommend based on the lid alone. It sunk in when I sat on it (I'm pretty light) and shifted around. For the extra cost of about $25, I bought a Kohler toilet, which came equipped with a solid lid, no shifting.

It did come with a wax seal. The installation went in without any issues. I put the tank on after seating the toilet base which made it lighter to put in place. After replacing the bolts I put the wax free seal over the drain. It has bolt holes that come through the seal. This made it easier to place the base on the screws. The new seal instructions tells you how many bands to put over the drain based on where the flange is in relation to the floor. Mine was slightly below the floor so I used two bands on my installation. The base was above the floor before installing the nuts on the bolts. It settled nicely against the floor as I tightened the bolts. You can feel it when the base is solidly on the floor as you turn the nuts. I adjusted the filler valve to stop about 1/2 inch below the overflow pipe. I replaced the flexible line from the cut off valve and the toilet tank since the toilet is higher than the old unit. I turned on the shut off valve and it filled and flushed fine. Most of all, no leaks. It flushes amazingly well and uses very little water.",5,1.0,0.0

American Standard white is ""warmer"" than Kohler white, and it stands out like a sore thumb from the other white things in the bathroom (sink, tub) -- even though they are NOT Kohler, they are much closer to Kohler white. I naively thought ""white is white"". It is not. But that's not a deal-breaker, just disappointing. 2. The 16"" height I assumed was also a standard thing, but it turns out the Kohler units we had were 14"" and how shall I say it? They were more comfortable. We are not short people, either. If you play in the NBA, maybe 16"" is what you want. I've never noticed a toilet this high anywhere else, ever, and I almost want to buy new toilets just to go back to 14"". Maybe I'm weird, but the bottom line is: MEASURE YOUR CURRENT TOILET SEAT HEIGHT FIRST and if you like it, stick with it. Otherwise, it was impressive that it came with everything except the feed line. I ended up having to replace the valves on both of ours due to rust, and had to run back to buy SharkBites valves (which went on beautifully and look great). For the price, I can see why it comes with a regular toilet seat but it would've been nice if it came with the slow-close for a couple extra $. The toilet itself works great.",3,1.0,0.0

One for our master bathroom and one for the guest bathroom. I must say I was a bit nervous about this toilet vs. the Kohler due to some of the reviews posted here on Lowe's. But we went ahead and purchased the American Standard. We have been very happy with our purchase. A week in and all is well. We've had none of the problems others have mentioned like the water level being hard/difficult to adjust or the seat moving around. This being said we paid extra and had both toilets professionally installed by a local plumber contracted through Lowe's. The plumber did a wonderful job and we have not had any issues with the water level filling correctly. In fact when we flush either of the toilets they flush very well, fill very quickly and to the correct water level each time. We do not find them noisy at all. In fact our old toilets were much louder than these when filling. The seat provided is, in our opinion, just fine. It does not move and is just fine. Again, put on and tightened down by the plumber who did our installation. It is true that the seats are not the ""best"" but it is a toilet after all. We've had company over and everyone has remarked about how they liked the comfort height. All in all we are very happy with our purchase and would recommend this toilet to anyone.",5,1.0,0.0

You are to place this small rubber washer on the bolt and attach through the tank and seat and place your remaining metal washer and nut to fasten but not to tightly as per these insane instructions. Now you have a loose tank that if you tighten the way it should be will destroy the little rubber washer in the tank.

It adjusts by sliding the plastic float up and down. The seat is hard plastic and flimsy. The fixture especially the tank is not very attractive, as toilets go. It flushed very well after the adjustment although the bowl does tend to stain requiring brushing. This toilet would be a good fit for a small space on a tight budget.

Within two weeks of installation, the toilet seat started pulling away from the plastic bolts with slipping and sliding. Although it is warrantied for 1 year, the best Lowe's could do was send the install guy out to re-tighten the bolts. Once again, the seat is slipping and sliding with very little use. As far as I'm concerned, this is not a good value for all it cost me to have it installed. The seat is a necessary part of a toilet and I'd think that if the seat slips, American Standard would honor their warranty and replace the seat and bolts with something that works. I also think Lowe's overcharges with delivery, haul away and installation for a simple toilet install.

The holes are just behind where every other toilet I have installed or replaced the seat, mounting holes have been. When I put the bolts through the seat & bidet, I had to push back enough to almost crack the bidet sprayer housing.When I finally got the bolts tightened enough so the seat wouldn't shift, There was a 1"" gap between the seat & the bowl rim.

You really need to get the tank on tight because it almost seems to just be hanging on the edge without much support. Ok, the seat attachment is a complete joke. the plastic bolts for the seat come with plastic WINGED nuts. The problem is that there is not enough space to turn the plastic WING nuts because the stupid WING gets in the way!! You can't physically turn the nuts to tighten because the wing hits the china. What dummy thought of this?! They need to use NON-WINGED nuts, so the nut will tune because there is almost NO space for a nut...definitely not a nut with a HUGE WING on it!

Imagine if that last flush would have happened before we left for vacation? 60 gal/hour could turn into 10,000 gallons over the course of a week. All because of a shotty flap design on a $0.50 flap that is poorly designed and gets stuck constantly. Secondly, to get it to flush, I have to hold the flusher down for 2 to 3 seconds, otherwise the bowl just fills up and settles. Yes, I've tried numerous adjustments, but nothing helps.

When flushed at night, it would awaken either of us that was sleep, so we were looking for a bowl that would be quiet when flushed and refilling. This one worked out great! We can now use the potty at night and not wake the other. It's just a quick, not too loud, Swoosh sound and it's over. The only thing I do not like about the toilet is the height. I thought the right height would be great after having a standard height toilet. But I've since realized that standard height is better for me because I'm only 5' 3"". The right height does not allow the proper positioning for bowel movements when you're that short, so I have to resort to using a squatty potty when I use the potty in our master bath. But overall it's a great Bowl. Most times it's flushes completely, but occasionally I've got to double flush. The toilet seat is a little flimsy but, I do like the way it closes slowly and quietly.

Sometimes there isn't much water in the bowl. Without enough water in bowl, you may need to clean the bowl much more often than usual, if you know what I mean. This toilet does hold a good amount of water in bowl. As far as people saying they need to flush 2 or 3 times....all you need to do is hold down the flushing handle for an extra 1-2 seconds and you get more water flushing from the tank through the bowl. (Quick flush for # 1 and Hold down lever longer for a long flush for #2). It does have a cheap seat, but I used the seat I had instead. The Wax Ring is good. It is deep for a good seal and it has the flange on it. Don't forget to get a very long water supply line. If not sure how long, just get the longest one they have. If too long, you can just twist it into a circle. You'll never see it behind the toilet. This is a high toilet (17 1/2 inches to top of seat). My wife is 5' 4"" .

I may have to tell some of my heavier friends to use another bathroom with a wood seat. Flushes quickly and a vast improvement over the 20-year old Crane it replaced.

Of the three, at least one would be out of service at any given time due to clogging. Next to each of them was an assortment of plungers -- just the thing to create a high-class ambience in one's bathrooms. Even when they were working, two or even three flushes were sometimes required to clear the bowl. And like clockwork, something would go wrong with the innards -- the flapper, valve, handle, etc. -- that required a trip to Lowes and up to $50 of replacement parts. I first installed one of these American Standard toilets a few years ago, and I couldn't believe the results. Not one clog! No more need to keep a plunger nearby. The internal parts seem to be very high quality, too -- I haven't had a single failure. After another bout of clogs in the remaining two toilets provided by our builder, I decided to make American Standard *the* standard for our house -- a very wise decision! As other reviewers have noted, the installation is surprisingly easy. Included in the box is the round wax sealer and handy tools for tightening inaccessible nuts. All the parts inside the tank are assembled and ready to go. As another reviewer noted, you'll need a putty knife or something similar to clean the old wax off the flange -- it's really important to clean it well. TIP: Before heading off to Lowe's, examine the existing water supply line. Because your new toilet's tank is likely to be 2 -3"" higher than the existing tank, you'll probably need to purchase a new water supply line. Shut off the water, drain the tank, remove the existing water supply line, and take it with you -- that way, you'll be sure to purchase the correct water supply line (and you won't have to make another trip to Lowe's, like I did, to get the correct one). INSTRUCTIONS: Outstanding. Visual -- and well done. A model for other manufacturers to follow. Designed as a poster. Get some tape and hang it on the wall while you're working. SEAT: Most reviewers have criticized A.S. for including such a cheap, flimsy toilet seat with this otherwise excellent product. There is justice in their complaint, but I would like to say a word in the company's defense. These days, there really isn't any ""one size fits all"" toilet seat anymore... Some people prefer cushioned seats, while others prefer self-closers or open-front models. Still others like the seats with antimicrobial properties. We prefer self-closing seats, so the included seat would have wound up at the Salvation Army, no matter how well it was made. There are color choices, too. The cheap, white seat that's included enables A.S. to keep the price of the toilet down -- and surely, this toilet is a bargain. From my perspective, at least, I'd rather they kept the price down than provide me with a better toilet seat that I wouldn't use.",5,177.0,17.0

I’ve never had to use a stone or harsh chemicals to clean any of the other bowls, just weekly or every other week.

We decided on this toilet because of the reviews. There were no real negatives and especially important to us was having a toilet that would clean away waste efficiently (with one flush and leaving the bowl relatively clean). That is absolutely not this toilet. We had two of these installed this morning, and we couldn't be more disappointed. The tank is slow to fill and it doesn't fill with much water. The flush action is extremely poor. To be frank, I have thought about filling a bucket with water to add to the bowl as I flush it. as there is minimal water that comes into the bowl to take down waste products. I even checked to make sure the plumber had turned on the water valve all the way. I am not going to keep these toilets.

Assembly was super easy and convenient and saved me a lot of time (the no tools needed is really the truth). I lost all of that saved time and lots more with two problems I had. First was a return trip to the store to determine why my tank lid did not fit properly. I grew up the son of a plumber and worked in my fathers business for years and installed a lot of toilets - this lid did not sit on the tank properly...cover the front edge and the back edge showed - cover the back edge and the front edge showed. Checked the parts list, and tank and lid numbers matched. Lee in the Lumberton store was overly gracious (and trusting) and gave me a different number tank and lid for me to try. I had to remove the supplied tank and reinstall the different tank. (No tools required.) Tank and lid now fit and looked right. How does a manufacturer send out a product that offers needless frustration like this? But a deeper frustration set in when i was ready to operate the toilet. I hit the flush lever and released it - like everyone in America is used to doing. The flapper came up and immediately closed back. No bowl flush at all. Thus ensued a quest on the internet to find some instructions for the fluidmaster 540 flapper operation. The site offered by Am Std was for the fill valve only..no good. I finally found a help site that reviewed how to adjust the flapper by rotating the clear bulb. It comes set on 1 but needs to be set on 10. Why would a manufacturer send out a product intentionally set not to operate properly? A word of caution on the adjustment of the flapper (which you will find no information about on fluidmaster or am std sites)--do not attempt to rotate the clear bulb in position - you'll break off all the setting tabs. Remove the bulb by depressing the two extruded tabs with a small screwdriver to release the bulb. Pull it straight out and then reinsert it to the 10 setting. My toilet now flushes properly with just a push of the lever and release. I was 10 minutes away from boxing the whole thing up and returning it for a Kohler. Too much manufacturer frustration for something as basically simple as a toilet. Now I still have another return trip to the store to return the first tank and lid.",3,55.0,18.0

To give you a sense of my skill level, I have probably installed at least 5 toilets in my life but I am certainly no plumber, a very low-grade DIY at best. I found this to be a very easy to install toilet. I really did not notice it being heavier than other toilets that I installed. I had to cart it up to a 2nd floor location but by taking the bowl and tank separately it was not that difficult. I can see how it could be excessively heavy for some but not more so than other toilets I have toted. Installation took me about 1/2 hour--very straightforward. I saw some comments to the effect that installing the tank was tricky and took 2 people. I had no problem doing it by my self. My only complaint is the flush. I saw the flush rating was ""4 to 5--best"". The flush on this unit is significantly weaker than the other toilets in my house but those toilets are older, 1.6 gallons per flush compared to the 1.28 gallons per flush of this unit. Not surprisingly, I would say the flush is about 25% less than the older toilets. I am sure the flush is limited by regulation and it may be that this one does just fine compared to other 1.28 gpf units. I wish American Standard had come up with a design that compensated for the reduced flush volume. I just know I am going to have to keep the plumbers friend close by when using this toilet.",4,5.0,0.0

Got my tools back out, removed the tank, re-read the instructions to make sure I wasn't missing something, and re-installed, swapping the bolts and washers just to try to eliminate the small leak....Turned on the water and it's leaking even worse.... Took the tank back off and put the tank together on the counter, using sockets so that I was able to tighten the tank bolts/washers...After an hour, I have a puddle of water on the counter leaking from a hairline crack that runs half-way across the bottom of the tank....Needless to say, I am heading to Lowe's with the tank as soon as I am done typing this...I am hoping that they will willingly swap just the tank out as I have no desire to pull the installed bowl back up and cleaning all the wax off the bottom...

(I think it was a 1.6 GPF model.) Last week I had two of the 1.28 GPF ""Saver"" models installed in the other bathrooms, thinking they would be just as satisfactory since the advertised features and appearance were the same. Well, not quite. Stuff ejected under high gas pressure does stick to the back of the toilet despite the ""Power Wash"" and ""Ever Clean"" bowl surface. (However, a stream of water from an adjacent shower hose immediately removes it.) This is my only disappointment. In an attempt to improve performance I used the adjustment screw in the tank to raise the water level to the maximum. Then, after reading the review by ""plumbingsemipro"" (November 11, 2012) and following his helpful instructions, I adjusted the flapper, which was set on 8, to the number 10 setting. These adjustments have a marginal effect and probably increased the GPF to about 1.5. Nevertheless, the most effective operational tip is to hold the handle down for a full three seconds to fully drain the tank - and then use a shower hose when necessary. (I have an idea that the round bowl model would be less likely to have this problem but the elongated bowl is what everyone wants for seating comfort.) As for the cheap toilet seat, when I first tried each toilet, I noted a sharp square edge on the underside of the seat pressing into my flesh. A few minutes with a fine grade sanding block rounded the edges sufficiently for reasonable comfort. Yes, the lid does buckle when I sit on it (185 lbs) but the depression is comfortable and it shows no signs of cracking. So, for the time being I will save the $40 or more per seat to replace them and continue to use them. I did purchase a better grade wax ring, to be on the safe side, and the water inlet connection line for each toilet. Since I live in Florida I opted to have them installed to avoid paying sales tax on the merchandise. That, along with Lowe's 40% discount on the second installation, brought the net installation cost per toilet to $65. Something you might want to consider under similar circumstances if you don't want to wrestle with heavy crockery and want the installation to be fast and guaranteed.",4,4.0,0.0

Since I live quite a distance from the store it wasn't worth my time to take it back. I would suggest you check the porcelain before you leave the store. The flushing works well so far. If you want more water add a small extension to the overflow tube. The new water ""rules"" may create a problem in the sewer lines with inadequate water volume to keep solids flowing.

The flushing power of this toilet is poor! I read the literature on the toilet before I bought it. Product info said that it was rated BEST 4 out of 5 in flush power. The toilet will not move the TP around the side or front of the toilet with out a few flushes which defeats the purpose of a 1.28 gallon flush toilet. Noticed that the water holes that are used to flush the water down the sides are very small and very little water comes out. I adjusted the flapper valve to the highest #10.Didnt work. Some of the valves set at the factory are set at #1 for minimum water flow. Long story short. Went to Amazon and ordered the ""Flush Saver 3"" Standard Lever handle dual flush kit"" . Set both high and low flush rates to max. Also set the over flow pipe and float to max so the tank would fill much higher. WOW, what a difference in flush power! Long and powerful flush. No more problems! Only cost about $34.",1,1.0,0.0

Now we save on water but use twice the amount of toilet paper. Can't understand your term of ""Everclean"". Also, the standing water level in the bowl is extremely low which allows solids to stick to dry bowl sides. We keep a 20 oz. cup on tank with a post-it saying to add 1 cup of water to bowl before using. Very disappointed in the only brand that I trusted in all of my installations for the past 48 years.

The amount of water it appears to use seems like it wouldn't do the job but it does and it does it very well. I don't know if this is an intended design feature but this toilet has a pseudo dual flush. If you press and release the handle immediately it uses less water (about half the tank)  than if you press the handle and hold it down which empties the tank.

WRONG!!!!! We live 25 miles from Lowe's, so we made sure to get everything I needed to get it done so no extra trips. We were assured that everything we needed to install was in the box. I head a friend that showed up and said he would help me so it would be even faster I thought. Again WRONG!!!! First it was late when we got home about an hour and a half before Lowe's closed for the night. Instead of unpacking the new toilet and checking to make sure everything was there while I was lugging the old one out my friend just pulled everything out of the box and had it just setting there when I came back in. Now I have installed toilets many times when I use to remodel homes, so getting the old wax ring up and the new one down and the bolts to secure the toilet didn't take long. Now when it came to installing the tank on the back. We couldn't find the nuts that went on the pre installed bolts in the tank. I went back to the box and looked in every piece of folded cardboard just to see if he had just over looked them,not the case. So now I drive all the way back to Lowe's to get the nuts. The gentleman that helped us has very nice and just gave us the nuts and the nifty little plastic holder that was supposed to come with mine. Drive all the way home and now I'm ready to do this. I looked at the doughnut gasket that goes between the tank and the bowl and it seemed a little small to me but it has been awhile since I had had to do this so I figured that it was just smaller so it would be a perfect fit and cut down on cost. WRONG!!! I couldn't get it to stay on and now I'm feeling like a fool because I can't get something so simple to work. Finally I got it to stay on long enough to bolt it down. Success I thought. Wrong when I flushed it I flooded my bathroom! Now it's too late to go back because Lowe's is now closed. Thank GOD we have 2 bathrooms in our home is all I can say. As soon as the doors opened the next morning I was there again the same gentlemen that had helped the night before was a little shocked to see me standing there. When he asked ""well did you get it all taken care of last night?"" I handed home the donut gasket and ask if maybe he could show me how that was supposed to fit. We walked back to the same box he had opened the night before and pulled out the donut gasket from that box. As he shook his head he said he had never seen so many things go wrong with one toilet ever. When I got home put the new donut gasket on and it NOW works like a charm. It's a great toilet if you get all the parts you need. Oh yeah I also tried calling the 1-800 number for help when I was first trying to get the donut gasket to fit it was too late and the call center was closed. In what I spent in gas driving back and forth I could have hired someone to do it. If you do decide to get this PLEASE open it up right there and make sure all the right parts are in fact in the box.",1,1.0,0.0

That's the one I wanted -- but it wouldn't fit in the space. In fact, this is one of the few toilets that did fit in my small space. So I bought it, installed it and waited to make a judgment until its first real test. It passed with flying colors. Since then, it has had numerous tests. Each time I've been amazed at its swallowing capacity. That other toilet I wanted has nothing on this one -- it has swallowed the equivalent of two or three dozen golf balls.

I spent hours researching toilets before my purchase. Every aspect of this toilet is exactly what I was looking for. It has a powerful flush, an elongated bowl, a classic design and it takes up less floorspace than the Kohler round bowl from 2012 it replaced. This American Standard toilet looks nicer, flushes better and has the aforementioned elongated bowl! This is an excellent toilet for the price. I'm impressed with the quality of the parts. Many toilets I looked at had parts made in China. The tank and bowl on this toilet are made in Mexico. The inner workings of the tank are quality Fluidmaster parts. Major home improvement stores carry Fluidmaster replacement parts. As for the seat, it's what I expected. It is a standard plastic seat and it's not uncomfortable. It can always be replaced with with one that better suits you but this seat suits me just fine. Everything needed for installation is in the box including brass floor bolts, a wax ring and simple instructions with just a few steps and detailed illustrations. I installed it in less than an hour by myself. Again, I am very pleased with my purchase.",5,0.0,0.0

So then you have to flush 2x to make it go away. No savings there! What I found was you have to stand there and hold the handle down until everything goes the drain - it's like you are using an old finicky toilet from the 50's.

I purposely chose the 1.6 over the water saving 1.28 because I heard multiple flushes were often and more likely needed with them. Surprisingly, this 1.6 has a like problem but, I don't believe it is due to the lack of water. On the contrary, more to do with the design of the flow. When flushing the water doesn't much swirl around to do what you can envision it needs to do at times. Rather, it just drops down and out with the minimal flow experienced being the start of the refill. Disappointingly, I have to flush multiple times as I feared I would have to do with the 1.28gpf and even with multiple flushes, I have to resort to the brush because, as I stated previously, the water doesn't get to all of the bowl surface. Is this unique to American Standard? Possibly. They all have their design. Would it be unique to the price? It's not a budget toilet by far, those $96 specials. So, I don't know. I only know what I am experiencing and want to share this experience with you. Now, I know some of you have your mind in the toilet. So keep it to yourself!

I have mostly bought total Drakes in the past which are the top rated by most plumbers. that is what I'm comparing this to and also American Standard Cadet 3 which is also a very fine toilet. I paid $100 for this toilet and had someone else install it but I normally install them myself. I had the Fluidmaster waxless seal which work great. this toilet has quality features usually seen in toilets twice to three times the price. first of all it has a 3 inch flush valve and a fully glazed 2 in trapway. the fill valve is a Fluidmaster which is the top of the line. the flapper appears to be just a standard 3 inch flapper. when comes to replacing it I'm going to use a Fluidmaster which has a silicone seat on it and a hard plastic frame. I measured the water spot which is slightly smaller than the American Standard get three I measured 8 in or slightly above front to back. my complaints about the total Drake is that it has more skid marks and not as good a wash down as some of the ever brands. I think American Standard has a little better wash down. both Americans standard and Toto have special treatments on the glazing inside the bowl. I have found that the project Source toilet flushes in my opinion as strongly as a total Drake and possibly stronger than the Cadet 3. I think it's washed down it's about similar to both of those or possibly better than the total Drake. the total Drake and the American Standard are advertisers having special extra smooth glaze within the bowl. that was not an advertised specialty of this toilet but I did not notice much difference. Some things I point out as negative. 1) the siphon trap has a kink in it compared to the American Standard check my picture out. 2)the tank to bowl bolts appear to be brass plated Steel. when buying it I would buy some solid brass or stainless steel tank to bowl bolts. 3)the water spot is slightly smaller than the American Standard Cadet 3 but I felt that the wash down is just as good or better than the Cadet 3 and definitely better than the total drake. overall a great value. I highly recommend it. see my photos. #1. water spot size 8 in. #2 trapway has a kink in it not straight like the American Standard possibly a source of Clogs. #3 picture of the fill valve and flush valve inside the tank appears to be Fluidmaster fill valve and a very nice 3 in flush valve.,5,6.0,0.0

The kit comes with everything you need to install it including a wax ring although I ended up using a jumbo ring for a more durable seal. I also really liked how the tank was completely assembled including the studs in the bottom. I didn’t have to rig up the flush system or anything, really making this a nearly tool-less installation. I did end up upgrading the handle with a black Korky kit from Lowe’s to match my other toilet, as well as a soft close American Standard seat, but even with those it was about $150 all in.

The mounting parts for the bowl to the floor are better (hand tighten bolts and snap on covers). The flushing mechanism is simple and yet they raised it off the bottom of the fill tank a couple inches which lets sediment and such (big here in Tucson) fall to the bottom which I think is a better design. I put in two of these new models in this week and I'm pleased with them.

Rather than remove the toilets and argue with lowes for a retuen, i purchased the fluidmaster 3” valve kit for $16.98. The swap is relatively simple and only requires removing the bolts holding the tank to the base. In total, its about a 10-15 minute fix. Make sure to adjust the flapper to 10 so it stays open longer for a better flush. In the end, the toilet now works but at an additinal cost, time, and effort.

After finding out HOW to adjust it from between 1-10 on the stupid thing, it makes no difference. Slams right shut, so if you want any actual water for flushing, you can stand there and hold down the handle. Entire piece of junk is going back tomorrow. What a huge waste of time.

I read 100s of bad reviews. most of which were from missing parts, damaged merchandise, or complaints about cheap seats. this review could easily have been bad if I used that metric. the first one I picked up was damaged. I discovered this because I was meticulously was checking everything, cracks, loose bolts, and for anything that might cause a problem with my installation. had I checked it out a little bit before I left the store, I wouldn't have had to make a 2nd trip. the second one one was perfect, installation was a breeze and it flushed fabulous, however when flushed only half the water escapes before the flap closes. this however is plenty of water and flush normal daily duty stuff. the awesome part is that if you need to, you could hold down the handle and get a super flush. all the guts inside are standard on the shelf items, which is why I couldn't just fix my old one. so that's awesome. lastly the seat....it was given for free, and as they say you get what you pay for, so if you want a nice seat buy one, this one is just fine for me. bottom line LOVE THIS TOILET.!!!",5,5.0,0.0

We had to hold the handle down a couple seconds to get it to flush all the way. It’s supposed to be able to flush elephant turds but, nah, it’s just a regular toilet. Once we’d had it for maybe a year, it started to intermittently run. It got worse and worse, then eventually we received a letter from the city, saying we appeared to have a water leak… somewhere. Well, that’s where. So, before we drained the reservoir, we read a bunch of diagnostic stuff online and the consensus was to replace the flush valve. So we ordered one and replaced it. It doesn’t leak anymore… for now. But check this out. The silicone seal under the flapper cover was blown up like a balloon in a spot, making it impossible to have sealed. I’ll try to add a photo of the crazy flush valve and flapper seal. So, keep in mind if you buy this toilet, 169 bucks sounds like a good deal, especially if it can flush a bucket of golf balls.

Most important to know is that the American Standard Mainstream toilet does the job in one flush, and an added surprise bonus, it does so quietly. The boxes from Lowes were sealed, with no evidence of rough handling. Upon box opening, the toilet had not been damaged, and nothing was missing. Each box clearly states that it is furnished with a slow-close seat. The American Standard website for this model says the same... It is NOT furnished with that seat. Called the A.S. Customer Service line at 855-815-0004 and got the correct slow-close seats a week later. Easy fix! I throughly read the instructions, which in my opinion were well written and clearly illustrated. Over the years, I have installed more than a few new toilets... So this was not my first time doing this and I did not expect the install to go perfectly. The first toilet install was the learning curve. The second had the same identical issues, but went quicker because I knew to look for them... Two issues arose during both installs, that in my humble opinion, should not have happened. I took the extra step of trial fitting the bottom toilet half over the flange (sans wax ring), to check rough-in clearance... To uncover that the base rocked front to back. Sigh. Turns out that the toilet has an arc shaped 'feature' in front of the outlet port that protrudes ~1/8"" below the perimeter base, causing the rocking. In my case, I chose to modify my tile floor, by very carefully removing tile in the arc shaped area of interference. Repeated the dry fit process, until the rocking stoped. Success! The base was now rock solid. Onto carefully installing the tank... Which at first try, leaked under one of the rubber washer/tank bolt. After cleaning out/drying the tank, I discovered porcelain burrs and protruding sharp edges at both of the two tank bolt holes... The very spot where the rubber washer is supposed to seal. Sigh! At this point, I chose to see if I could carefully deburr and remove the sharp edges inside the tank at these two bolt holes... Long story short, it worked. Re-installed the tank without leaks. Hopefully, American Standard reads these reviews and ultimately fixes the quality of their products. Ultimately, I like these: The install issues were not that difficult to overcome. The toilets work way better than what they replaced. To boot, American Std Customer Service reps were easy to work with... Nice.",4,31.0,0.0

As just mentioned, I paid for Lowes installation and the installer was fine once he showed up. The 'complete toilet in a box' was fine with everything included. I like the extra height (about 1 inch higher than standard) and it is (so far) functioning well after a month of daily use. No leaks or cracks. The plumber had no issues. He recommended a second wax seal which he provided for free stating that the one included was too thin and would not last that long. This toilet has a strong flush and I'm happy to see that the interior fill valve is quiet and has an 'old style' flapper not the piston design which American Standard has a class action lawsuit due to a leaking seal. Maybe they changed the design and I got lucky because I did not know this until after I researched AS toilets. If this lasts, it was a good purchase at the price and I will recommend it after a month of daily use. Also, no slow close seat was included.

It takes so much effort and time before you realize if you’ve made a good or bad decision. And no matter what toilet you see online at any price range you’ll find that ONE person who claims its a piece of crap. (Pun intended) I can honestly say I have no complaints about this toilet. I hired a handyman to install 2 of them in my house and he said I should buy that extra thick wax seal, but he end up not needing it because the seal that comes with this toilet it really good. One of the toilets was missing some seals for the bolts, and after we installed both toilets, one of them had a tiny leak coming out from one of the two bolts that holds the tank to the bowl. Ended up being a small imperfection in the porcelain, a little burr right where the washer needs to press down to seal it. We just scraped it off with a screwdriver and then it worked fine. So all in all I’m not raving and saying this is some amazing quality toilet, but it does exactly what I need it to do . A solid four stars.",4,11.0,2.0

I'm listing this because there are so many brands to choose from and my choice is made after research and reading reviews and by my past experience (I've changed my share in my life). People seem to hate some and love others, but I try to see what's available and seems to be the best deal. Some give you 1.6 gallons per flush but ours gives you 1.28. It's an American Standard Mainstream (elongated) for $159. For $149 you can get the same toilet but round. It works good (some competing toilets had pretty pathetic flushing). I timed it and from flush to full, it takes 20 seconds (that surprised me). We always replace the cheap plastic seats with white wood seats... If you tighten all nuts with another nut tightened against them, they never come loose (I do this with 3 or 4 nuts each time)... that is especially important when attaching the seat. Seats always like to come loose. Use 2 rubber washers per bolt to avoid cracking it (even with 2 rubber washers, I'm careful not to over-tighten). I always make sure that the rubber washers are directly against the china. On the 2 bolts that attach it to the floor, I stack 2 rubber washers. The middle of each rubber washer should be just big enough to fit around the bolt. The outside diameter of each rubber washer should be big enough to completely cover the hole, but not too big that it can't lay flat (some areas give you much less room to work with). I don't use ones that are bigger than needed. On the bolts that bolt it to the floor, I make sure that the washers are small enough to be hidden under the white screw on caps. I cut each bolt short enough so they can screw on clear down to the china. I only use stainless steel washers and bolts and nuts (the stainless steel washers go on top of the rubber washers). In the tank you can't use a washer... just the bolt head on a rubber washer. It's surprising how long the rubber washers last (I never have to change them). In some applications, rubber doesn't last very long at all.",5,8.0,1.0

Installation was fairly easy until I put the tank on. The right side bolt was leaking. After draining it and removing the bolt, I saw a small ""glob"" of porcelain next to the hole.

The tank barely fills half way and dos not let all of the water out unless you hold the handle down. However, it does seem to flush sufficiently, so perhaps the design is ok. Time will tell. They do make tube extensions to allow filling the tank more, but that will be a last resort. Overall, I am pleased with it. I dropped one star for the QC on the tank and for the short overflow tube.

Something has changed, and they are now a disaster. The two I recently purchased were manufactured in March of 2019 in Mexico at Namce Ceramics, and the specs are all wrong. Perhaps they used centimeters in Mexico instead of inches, but the base is at least two inches shorter than it used to be. Even so, it might work except that the tank does not sit level on the base anymore. It is neither level from side-to-side nor front-to-back, causing it to pitch forward. This makes it very uncomfortable to sit on the toilet, and negates the elongation because urine splashes up onto the back of the seat. When one stands to urinate, one must hold up the seat the entire time because it will not stay up on its own. That would be a mere inconvenience, except that it's completely unsanitary since urine is on the back of the seat from those who sit to urinate. It's a disaster and I will no longer buy these toilets. Home Depot/Glacier Bay, please return to the previous manufacturer and specs for these toilets. It would also be nice if Home Depot would acknowledge that these toilets manufactured in Mexico are defective, and issue refunds to those of us who have purchased them.",1,,

The HD toilet expert who helped us explained that all of the toilets are made in China and Glacier Bay is as good as any of them. I should have read the reviews prior to purchase. I purchased the toilet this past Saturday and installed on Sunday. Upon unwrapping the parts, I noticed there were some cosmetic defects on the bowl, such as drips from the glazing process and a spot where there was no glaze. Decided to overlook these cosmetic imperfections and went ahead and installed it. The top of the tank does not fit onto the tank and the tank did not sit properly on the bowl. I also noticed a chip at the bottom of the tank where it meets the base. The installation was not very easy either. In addition, if you are going from a shorter toilet to this higher toilet, you will need to get a longer water line. The plastic seat also does not sit evenly on the bowl. Will be returning this toilet ASAP. It did not meet my expectations. Not much quality control on this product. I cannot recommend this toilet but if you decide to buy this toilet, be sure to dry fit all parts first before installing.",1,,

Be prepared to clean the bowl every time you have a bowel movement. Some times two flushes will clear it, others require the bowl brush. The flushing action is very poor. I purchased two of these. I will probably replace them soon. I'll write it off to you get what you pay for. - Cheers",2,,

The only issue I had was getting the caps for the tank bolts to snap onto the plastic washer they mate with. The plastic washers are not thick enough to properly accept the caps when installed per the instructions. I had to disassemble and place a washer between the base of the toilet and the plastic washer to raise the plastic washer up enough to allow the caps to snap into place, which worked very well. This bowl stores less water than other toilets I have owned. This is probably not an issue for adults but you might want to think about another toilet if you have children using it as they tend to sit forward on the seat. Seat is not a soft close type either. Attractive design - if you can say that about a toilet.",4,,

Make sure you check for leaks. My new toilet works great and is very quiet when filling up. Very modern looking and has a slow closing lid which works very smoothly.

Thankful a quality toilet seat was included. The flush has excellent water pressure to clear the bowl.

It took about an hour including some necessary floor prep. It comes in three pieces - the base, the tank, and the seat. It's very easy to assemble. Two nuts and bolts and wax ring (included) to mount base to floor. Two nuts and bolts and rubber seal (included) to mount tank to base. Two nuts and bolts (also included) to mount seat to base. After connecting the water supply hose and turning the water on, I noticed it was quieter and a quicker refill than the previous toilet. Note: I needed a 12"" supply hose (which I had) instead of the old 9"" one. Be careful trimming the base mounting bolts - I recommend a small to medium pair of bolt cutters. I didn't need to adjust the water level, but the instructions explain how to do it. I'm very pleased with the new toilet.",5,,

The installation went very smoothly all I needed was provided with the toilet including a new wax seal. The instruction were clear and easy to follow. Accessing and tightening the nuts connecting the tank to the toilet was a bit tricky but not too bad. Overall a very easy installation. The new toilet is now easier to clean, quieter and uses less water for what appears to be a better flush. So I am very happy with the final installation. The most difficult part was removing the old toilet as the previous installation used a lot of caulk around the toilet and I had to force a chisel under the old toilet.

The box this came in was a little beat up but the toilet was in perfect condition. It was fairly easy for 1 person to replace the old toilet with this. Make sure you turn off the water before you unhook the hoses. Almost forgot that step. This does come with wax ring so you don't have to buy one of those. Be careful setting it over the bolts that should already be coming out of the floor. If you hit it wrong you could break the toilet base. I recommend 2 people to put it in place if you have room to maneuver it. I like that it has a smaller tank. Takes up less room so I can fit a narrow cabinet next to it against the wall to hold cleaning wipes, trash bags, etc. The handle is a pretty shiny chrome and in the front not the side. I like that better. Easier to spray with disinfectant when cleaning. It comes with a toilet seat that goes slow as it auto closes. But you do have to sort of start the motion or it won't lower by itself. Might be a cool feature if people actually do close the seat/lids on toilet. It sits really nice in the small area it's in. I have an elongated in my bathroom and wanted the same size in the boys bathroom so they'll stop using mine since they like my larger one better. So far no complaints on this elongated one.

The flush performance is surprisingly good for a 2 inch opening from tank to bowl. The description says the PowerWash rim scrubs the bowl clean with every flush. Sadly, I did not find that to be the case. Out of the box there was some small debris in the toilet bowl. Upon installing, I flushed three times and some of that debris on the side of the bowl did not budge. I had to gently swipe it with a piece of toilet paper to get it off the bowl. Based on this, the bowl scrubbing action of PowerFlush is not working as advertised on my unit. My other complaint is with the marketing that says the trapway is fully glazed. Looking into the trapway from underneath the toilet where waste will eject into the drain shows it is not glazed and the surface is rough. Perhaps this is a defect in my unit but if you are going to market this as a feature, every toilet should be checked to ensure it was properly glazed before it is boxed for shipping. I also found the underside of the rim where water exits to clean the bowl is not glazed. By having a rough and porous surface here, it invites mold growth. My particular model is standard height (15 inches) with a 12 inch rough in and the elongated bowl. My installation location is a 10 inch rough in. I did a lot of measuring to ensure the toilet would fit so I decided to install it in the 10 inch location. After installation there was a 1/4 inch gap between the tank and the wall which was acceptable for me. After a few days of use, no clogs and no need to hold the handle down during the flush cycle to force more water out of the tank during the flush. The toilet has a nice look and the slow close plastic seat is wonderful. I experienced no leaks after installation. While the toilet is working well after a few days of use, I cannot recommend it because the selling features of PowerScrub and a fully glazed trapway are not true for the unit I received.",3,,

Should last a good while.",WithReviews,"May 23, 2022","When grandma has to use the plunger on your toilet, it might be a sign your old toilet needs to be replaced. Embarrassingly, my old toilet fit this description; it was not really a strong flusher and could easily get clogged. This American Standard toilet is not going to blow you away with any bells and whistles, but it does what it says it’ll do, and it does it well. I have not put it to the ultimate “gallon of golf balls” equivalent test yet, but it has easily handled what I’ve thrown at it, and I like how it looks in our bathroom. The internal hardware is your bare bones toilet accoutrement; no fancy dual flush or anything that will break easily or be hard to maintain when it does, which is good for long term maintenance. No proprietary parts that will cost 2x the generic stuff either. At just 1.28 gallons per flush, it’s pretty efficient even without the “dual flush” function other toilets have anyway. Everything needed to complete the install came with the toilet (minus the tools and perhaps a caulk sealer for the bottom, but that’s expected), so install was pretty simple as well. I did find a small blemish in the porcelain of the toilet bowl, but I don’t notice it unless I’m close to the toilet bowl to clean it. Getting super nit-picky, the seat itself might be a bit warped; one side does not lay perfectly flat on the porcelain ledge when the other side is. Speaking of the seat, it is fairly comfortable to sit in. It does not have a quick release function to help with cleaning around the hinge area, though, which would’ve been nice to have. I like that the bowl doesn’t have any extra “levels” and is smooth all around. Each flush sends a flow of water all around the toilet bowl to keep things fairly clean, and I like that the bowl has a decent level of water in it to hopefully catch stuff without leaving any…uh, skid marks. Overall, this toilet should be easy to clean and hopefully not require cleaning as often. The flush and tank refill are also pretty quiet, which is nice. Overall, I think this is a great toilet that should last many years. I have one other toilet that is about the same age as my old one that this replaced, so while I want to take a few more weeks to put this thing through its paces, this is definitely a strong candidate to replace that toilet as well.",4,,

Nice features to have out of the box. Everything you need to install comes with it in the packaging, so it is pretty much ready to go, again, out of the box. Pressure for flushing seems to be highly optimized and does flush with with what seems to be higher and more consistent pressure. At I.28 gpf it counts as water saving since most toilets after ‘94 have 1.6gpf or higher. So this will go a long way to save water. I especially love the slow close plastic seat. I always replace the standard seats with slow close plastic ones, and I find them to be more comfortable. So it’s nice that a toilet finally comes packed with one. Valve is pre installed, it’s a two piece setup so just bolt on the tank, put wax ring on, and finish up. All instructions included. Very nice, very efficient toilet.
