0,1,0.4963925,0.39047065,0.11313686,It looks like I got the same mislabeled box as others that purchased these. The box states “slow close seat” and the lids are not slow close.

3,4,0.5835963,0.34097382,0.07542994,"Since this toilet was brand new, it was slow to flush. We had to hold the handle down a couple seconds to get it to flush all the way. It’s supposed to be able to flush elephant turds but, nah, it’s just a regular toilet. Once we’d had it for maybe a year, it started to intermittently run. It got worse and worse, then eventually we received a letter from the city, saying we appeared to have a water leak… somewhere. Well, that’s where. So, before we drained the reservoir, we read a bunch of diagnostic stuff online and the consensus was to replace the flush valve. So we ordered one and replaced it. It doesn’t leak anymore… for now. But check this out. The silicone seal under the flapper cover was blown up like a balloon in a spot, making it impossible to have sealed. I’ll try to add a photo of the crazy flush valve and flapper seal. So, keep in mind if you buy this toilet, 169 bucks sounds like a good deal, especially if it can flush a bucket of golf balls. But In a year you might need a plumber to replace the bloated flush valve to the tune of $250, plus all the water it wasted before you reached critical mass!",2,4,1,Negative

10,12,0.78723717,0.17583866,0.03692413,"I self-installed two model 734AA.101.020 toilets in my home to replace poorly performing 1.6 gpf builder grade toilets from 2001. Most important to know is that the American Standard Mainstream toilet does the job in one flush, and an added surprise bonus, it does so quietly. The boxes from Lowes were sealed, with no evidence of rough handling. Upon box opening, the toilet had not been damaged, and nothing was missing. Each box clearly states that it is furnished with a slow-close seat. The American Standard website for this model says the same... It is NOT furnished with that seat. Called the A.S. Customer Service line at 855-815-0004 and got the correct slow-close seats a week later. Easy fix! I throughly read the instructions, which in my opinion were well written and clearly illustrated. Over the years, I have installed more than a few new toilets... So this was not my first time doing this and I did not expect the install to go perfectly. The first toilet install was the learning curve. The second had the same identical issues, but went quicker because I knew to look for them... Two issues arose during both installs, that in my humble opinion, should not have happened. I took the extra step of trial fitting the bottom toilet half over the flange (sans wax ring), to check rough-in clearance... To uncover that the base rocked front to back. Sigh. Turns out that the toilet has an arc shaped 'feature' in front of the outlet port that protrudes ~1/8"" below the perimeter base, causing the rocking. In my case, I chose to modify my tile floor, by very carefully removing tile in the arc shaped area of interference. Repeated the dry fit process, until the rocking stoped. Success! The base was now rock solid. Onto carefully installing the tank... Which at first try, leaked under one of the rubber washer/tank bolt. After cleaning out/drying the tank, I discovered porcelain burrs and protruding sharp edges at both of the two tank bolt holes... The very spot where the rubber washer is supposed to seal. Sigh! At this point, I chose to see if I could carefully deburr and remove the sharp edges inside the tank at these two bolt holes... Long story short, it worked. Re-installed the tank without leaks. Hopefully, American Standard reads these reviews and ultimately fixes the quality of their products. Ultimately, I like these: The install issues were not that difficult to overcome. The toilets work way better than what they replaced. To boot, American Std Customer Service reps were easy to work with... Nice.",4,31,0,Negative

As just mentioned, I paid for Lowes installation and the installer was fine once he showed up. The 'complete toilet in a box' was fine with everything included. I like the extra height (about 1 inch higher than standard) and it is (so far) functioning well after a month of daily use. No leaks or cracks. The plumber had no issues. He recommended a second wax seal which he provided for free stating that the one included was too thin and would not last that long. This toilet has a strong flush and I'm happy to see that the interior fill valve is quiet and has an 'old style' flapper not the piston design which American Standard has a class action lawsuit due to a leaking seal. Maybe they changed the design and I got lucky because I did not know this until after I researched AS toilets. If this lasts, it was a good purchase at the price and I will recommend it after a month of daily use. Also, no slow close seat was included.

I'm listing this because there are so many brands to choose from and my choice is made after research and reading reviews and by my past experience (I've changed my share in my life). People seem to hate some and love others, but I try to see what's available and seems to be the best deal. Some give you 1.6 gallons per flush but ours gives you 1.28. It's an American Standard Mainstream (elongated) for $159. For $149 you can get the same toilet but round. It works good (some competing toilets had pretty pathetic flushing). I timed it and from flush to full, it takes 20 seconds (that surprised me). We always replace the cheap plastic seats with white wood seats... If you tighten all nuts with another nut tightened against them, they never come loose (I do this with 3 or 4 nuts each time)... that is especially important when attaching the seat. Seats always like to come loose. Use 2 rubber washers per bolt to avoid cracking it (even with 2 rubber washers, I'm careful not to over-tighten). I always make sure that the rubber washers are directly against the china. On the 2 bolts that attach it to the floor, I stack 2 rubber washers. The middle of each rubber washer should be just big enough to fit around the bolt. The outside diameter of each rubber washer should be big enough to completely cover the hole, but not too big that it can't lay flat (some areas give you much less room to work with). I don't use ones that are bigger than needed. On the bolts that bolt it to the floor, I make sure that the washers are small enough to be hidden under the white screw on caps. I cut each bolt short enough so they can screw on clear down to the china. I only use stainless steel washers and bolts and nuts (the stainless steel washers go on top of the rubber washers). In the tank you can't use a washer... just the bolt head on a rubber washer. It's surprising how long the rubber washers last (I never have to change them). In some applications, rubber doesn't last very long at all.",5,8,1,Positive
