Here's what they don't tell you: If you just flush the toilet like normal not everything will go down the drain (even if you only used one small length of toilet paper). So then you have to flush 2x to make it go away. No savings there! What I found was you have to stand there and hold the handle down until everything goes the drain - it's like you are using an old finicky toilet from the 50's. This is the first time in about 30 years I did not own a Kohler brand toilet and I can say - I will never buy another toilet if it isn't a Kohler.",1,37,12,Negative

That being said, keeping the bowl clean after 'doing your business"" (#2) is not easy. The water line isn't high enough to catch what you're leaving, if you know what I mean. PLUS! I just came home after having these things for almost a year and the tank cracked. I have no idea how this happened but it cracked from the top. I'm about to contact American Standard to see if they'll replace it.",3,64,9,Negative
2,3,0.5237387,0.3910068,0.08525457,"I always linked the variance in price to looks, features, etc., but never did I think it would affect performance. I purposely chose the 1.6 over the water saving 1.28 because I heard multiple flushes were often and more likely needed with them. Surprisingly, this 1.6 has a like problem but, I don't believe it is due to the lack of water. On the contrary, more to do with the design of the flow. When flushing the water doesn't much swirl around to do what you can envision it needs to do at times. Rather, it just drops down and out with the minimal flow experienced being the start of the refill. Disappointingly, I have to flush multiple times as I feared I would have to do with the 1.28gpf and even with multiple flushes, I have to resort to the brush because, as I stated previously, the water doesn't get to all of the bowl surface. Is this unique to American Standard? Possibly. They all have their design. Would it be unique to the price? It's not a budget toilet by far, those $96 specials. So, I don't know. I only know what I am experiencing and want to share this experience with you. Now, I know some of you have your mind in the toilet. So keep it to yourself! I reserve the right to add an image or video in the future. lol. I""m trying to make the best of a bad situation so, don't let my humor deter you from the facts I pointed out. You'll be wasting your money and time to this ill designed waste disposal system. Good luck!",1,110,12,Negative

So I ordered it through Lowes. I noticed when it came in that it was double boxed and packaged with foam in between. Maybe American Standard finally learned how to ship a toilet properly through UPS. Now that it is finally installed I can honestly say this is a great toilet. I don't know why it is so hard to find an elongated bowl with the standard height, but it is. That is why I ordered this. I am very happy now, finally.",5,6,3,Positive

9,10,0.06378046,0.33281973,0.6033998,Wanted to upgrade my old round bowl. This was the perfect price and fit. The height is just right not the newer higher ones for people that can't stand up. With just a slight push the lever lets in enough water to flush everything unlike some models that you need to hold down to let enough water out.
