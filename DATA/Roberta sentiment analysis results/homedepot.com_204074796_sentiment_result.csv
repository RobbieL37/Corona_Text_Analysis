The pool of water in the bowl of 3 of them is very small, often resulting in solid waste being smeared well above the water line, where flushing will not easily remove it! One of the four toilets does have a ""normal sized"" pool of water. It is clear that it was not manufactured along with the other 3, it has different printing in the tank, despite having the same SKU number. I have included photos of both variations and their markings.",1,Neutral

Since I didn’t have any issues with the first one I purchased another. Bad decision. The quality has really declined, cheap, flimsy seating and lid that will not stay connected, does not line up.

I cannot comment on the assembly because I had it professionally installed. However, I did not hear any complaints from the installer. It looks exactly like the picture. My only complaint, if you can call it a complaint is that sometimes I’ve noticed you may have to flush twice to ensure everything goes down. If it’s all liquids it all goes down with one flush.

43,44,0.8489437,0.12986897,0.02118729,"These inexpensive Glacier Bay toilets used to be great, and for the past decade I put them in all of my houses without ever having any problems. Something has changed, and they are now a disaster. The two I recently purchased were manufactured in March of 2019 in Mexico at Namce Ceramics, and the specs are all wrong. Perhaps they used centimeters in Mexico instead of inches, but the base is at least two inches shorter than it used to be. Even so, it might work except that the tank does not sit level on the base anymore. It is neither level from side-to-side nor front-to-back, causing it to pitch forward. This makes it very uncomfortable to sit on the toilet, and negates the elongation because urine splashes up onto the back of the seat. When one stands to urinate, one must hold up the seat the entire time because it will not stay up on its own. That would be a mere inconvenience, except that it's completely unsanitary since urine is on the back of the seat from those who sit to urinate. It's a disaster and I will no longer buy these toilets. Home Depot/Glacier Bay, please return to the previous manufacturer and specs for these toilets. It would also be nice if Home Depot would acknowledge that these toilets manufactured in Mexico are defective, and issue refunds to those of us who have purchased them.",1,Negative

The HD toilet expert who helped us explained that all of the toilets are made in China and Glacier Bay is as good as any of them. I should have read the reviews prior to purchase. I purchased the toilet this past Saturday and installed on Sunday. Upon unwrapping the parts, I noticed there were some cosmetic defects on the bowl, such as drips from the glazing process and a spot where there was no glaze. Decided to overlook these cosmetic imperfections and went ahead and installed it. The top of the tank does not fit onto the tank and the tank did not sit properly on the bowl. I also noticed a chip at the bottom of the tank where it meets the base. The installation was not very easy either. In addition, if you are going from a shorter toilet to this higher toilet, you will need to get a longer water line. The plastic seat also does not sit evenly on the bowl.

These bolts need to be just a little longer. Most toilets have bolts that install then can be cut off. Not sure if this is a new thing with all the manufacturers or just with Glacier Bay.,5,Neutral

315,316,0.9726034,0.02346502,0.003931686,I had American Standard toilet in my house for 19 years. One finally started showing stains and we remodeled our bathroom and replaced with this one. In 7 days it started showing brown stains at the bottom. It has the worst flushing power ever. You can barely flush a couple sheets of toilet paper before it stops up. And I have never had a toilet so difficult to try to plunge once it gets stopped up. What a terrible toilet. I'm going to replace with anything other than this brand. Waste of money!,1,Negative

I actually intended to buy the higher end Glacier Bay, but refuse to by any more junky, overpriced crap from China. I was disappointed to see that HD is importing toilets from there again .The last two Chinese toilets purchased from HD were horrible. This one from south of the border performs just fine and had some USA made parts included.",4,Negative
