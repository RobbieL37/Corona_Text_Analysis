As noted in my pictures, the flush valve is 3.5 inches above the base which leaves little available water to flush and, my tenant required two flushes (and a scrub brush to clean the side) so, if you want a full flush, that is long enough to ""do the job,"" buy another f...",4,32,9,Neutral
1,3,0.45010313,0.3587623,0.19113459,I've had this for about a month. I have mostly bought total Drakes in the past which are the top rated by most plumbers. that is what I'm comparing this to and also American Standard Cadet 3 which is also a very fine toilet. I paid $100 for this toilet and had someone else install it but I normally install them myself. I had the Fluidmaster waxless seal which work great. this toilet has quality features usually seen in toilets twice to three times the price. first of all it has a 3 inch flush valve and a fully glazed 2 in trapway. the fill valve is a Fluidmaster which is the top of the line. the flapper appears to be just a standard 3 inch flapper. when comes to replacing it I'm going to use a Fluidmaster which has a silicone seat on it and a hard plastic frame. I measured the water spot which is slightly smaller than the American Standard get three I measured 8 in or slightly above front to back. my complaints about the total Drake is that it has more skid marks and not as good a wash down as some of the ever brands. I think American Standard has a little better wash down. both Americans standard and Toto have special treatments on the glazing inside the bowl. I have found that the project Source toilet flushes in my opinion as strongly as a total Drake and possibly stronger than the Cadet 3. I think it's washed down it's about similar to both of those or possibly better than the total Drake. the total Drake and the American Standard are advertisers having special extra smooth glaze within the bowl. that was not an advertised specialty of this toilet but I did not notice much difference. Some things I point out as negative. 1) the siphon trap has a kink in it compared to the American Standard check my picture out. 2)the tank to bowl bolts appear to be brass plated Steel. when buying it I would buy some solid brass or stainless steel tank to bowl bolts. 3)the water spot is slightly smaller than the American Standard Cadet 3 but I felt that the wash down is just as good or better than the Cadet 3 and definitely better than the total drake. overall a great value. I highly recommend it. see my photos. #1. water spot size 8 in. #2 trapway has a kink in it not straight like the American Standard possibly a source of Clogs. #3 picture of the fill valve and flush valve inside the tank appears to be Fluidmaster fill valve and a very nice 3 in flush valve.,5,6,0,Negative

As soon as stores were open, there were long lines and shelves were empty. Fast forward a week, I had to replace two toilets and luckily I found this gem and it came with everything. When I say everythinng, I mean everything. Wax, bowl internals all came with the toilet and it was so easy to install. Directions were easy to read and it took more time hauling the old one out. Definitely a great buy! Also if your toilet wobbles becausebits not flat on the floor, you have to use wedges because your floor isn’t leveled. Use pennies, thats what I was told.",5,54,9,Negative

The kit comes with everything you need to install it including a wax ring although I ended up using a jumbo ring for a more durable seal. I also really liked how the tank was completely assembled including the studs in the bottom. I didn’t have to rig up the flush system or anything, really making this a nearly tool-less installation. I did end up upgrading the handle with a black Korky kit from Lowe’s to match my other toilet, as well as a soft close American Standard seat, but even with those it was about $150 all in. I like that it looks close enough to a Toto Drake in my master bathroom to pass on casual inspection, and the flush power of the 3” valve makes it reliable for even the most “demanding” guests.",5,24,4,Positive

When I showed up a Lowes a few days ago to find out they were discontinuing the line I was not pleased - but this is the replacement for it and it's easily as good and in fact they improved a few things. The mounting parts for the bowl to the floor are better (hand tighten bolts and snap on covers). The flushing mechanism is simple and yet they raised it off the bottom of the fill tank a couple inches which lets sediment and such (big here in Tucson) fall to the bottom which I think is a better design. I put in two of these new models in this week and I'm pleased with them.
