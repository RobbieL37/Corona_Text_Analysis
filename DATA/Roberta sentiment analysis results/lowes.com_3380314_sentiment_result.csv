1,2,0.047975317,0.36174592,0.59027874,"I have bought other toilets for a rental. Sometimes there isn't much water in the bowl. Without enough water in bowl, you may need to clean the bowl much more often than usual, if you know what I mean. This toilet does hold a good amount of water in bowl. As far as people saying they need to flush 2 or 3 times....all you need to do is hold down the flushing handle for an extra 1-2 seconds and you get more water flushing from the tank through the bowl. (Quick flush for # 1 and Hold down lever longer for a long flush for #2). It does have a cheap seat, but I used the seat I had instead. The Wax Ring is good. It is deep for a good seal and it has the flange on it. Don't forget to get a very long water supply line. If not sure how long, just get the longest one they have. If too long, you can just twist it into a circle. You'll never see it behind the toilet. This is a high toilet (17 1/2 inches to top of seat). My wife is 5' 4"" . She said "" any higher she would need a step stool"" but she likes the height. We have been using this for over a month now with no complaints or concerns.",5,21,1,Positive

After many failed attempts to fix the leak I broke down and purchased this toilet. Time to remove old toilet and install the new toilet was about 1.5 hours. The majority of that time was removing the old toilet and cleaning up the wax ring and caulk. Installing the new toilet probably only took 20 minutes. Everything in the tank was pre-installed which I LOVED. It took less time to install this then to replace the parts in my old toilet. Flush is very powerful, quiet and short. Would definitely recommend to others.",5,29,0,Positive

I especially liked the included ""tools"" that made installation easy plus the nylon wing nuts for the floor bolts. The only thing I did not like as well as the Kohler product is the included seat-it is very thin and flexes easily. I may have to tell some of my heavier friends to use another bathroom with a wood seat. Flushes quickly and a vast improvement over the 20-year old Crane it replaced.

Clean design, looks great. I also like the built in ""dam"" between the tank and bowl, stops liquid from gathering. Flush power is VERY impressive, box says it scores 1000 on MaP scale of 100 to 1000, and I can see why. Also someone FINALLY decided to invent taller caps to cover the bolts holding toilet to floor.

Another huge plus is that this toilet is extremely easy to install--no tools needed at all, perfect for any do it yourself novice. From start to finish install took me maybe 20 mins. The best part however is the flush! On the toilet that I purchased last year, you have to hold down the lever for ""larger"" flushes.

40,42,0.89138883,0.0965797,0.012031505,"We moved into our new house in 2001, and loved everything about it -- except for the 2000-vintage toilets, which were made by a well-known and respected manufacturer. Of the three, at least one would be out of service at any given time due to clogging. Next to each of them was an assortment of plungers -- just the thing to create a high-class ambience in one's bathrooms. Even when they were working, two or even three flushes were sometimes required to clear the bowl. And like clockwork, something would go wrong with the innards -- the flapper, valve, handle, etc. -- that required a trip to Lowes and up to $50 of replacement parts. I first installed one of these American Standard toilets a few years ago, and I couldn't believe the results. Not one clog! No more need to keep a plunger nearby. The internal parts seem to be very high quality, too -- I haven't had a single failure. After another bout of clogs in the remaining two toilets provided by our builder, I decided to make American Standard *the* standard for our house -- a very wise decision! As other reviewers have noted, the installation is surprisingly easy. Included in the box is the round wax sealer and handy tools for tightening inaccessible nuts. All the parts inside the tank are assembled and ready to go. As another reviewer noted, you'll need a putty knife or something similar to clean the old wax off the flange -- it's really important to clean it well. TIP: Before heading off to Lowe's, examine the existing water supply line. Because your new toilet's tank is likely to be 2 -3"" higher than the existing tank, you'll probably need to purchase a new water supply line. Shut off the water, drain the tank, remove the existing water supply line, and take it with you -- that way, you'll be sure to purchase the correct water supply line (and you won't have to make another trip to Lowe's, like I did, to get the correct one). INSTRUCTIONS: Outstanding. Visual -- and well done. A model for other manufacturers to follow. Designed as a poster. Get some tape and hang it on the wall while you're working. SEAT: Most reviewers have criticized A.S. for including such a cheap, flimsy toilet seat with this otherwise excellent product. There is justice in their complaint, but I would like to say a word in the company's defense. These days, there really isn't any ""one size fits all"" toilet seat anymore... Some people prefer cushioned seats, while others prefer self-closers or open-front models. Still others like the seats with antimicrobial properties. We prefer self-closing seats, so the included seat would have wound up at the Salvation Army, no matter how well it was made. There are color choices, too. The cheap, white seat that's included enables A.S. to keep the price of the toilet down -- and surely, this toilet is a bargain. From my perspective, at least, I'd rather they kept the price down than provide me with a better toilet seat that I wouldn't use.",5,177,17,Negative

Assembly was super easy and convenient and saved me a lot of time (the no tools needed is really the truth). I lost all of that saved time and lots more with two problems I had. First was a return trip to the store to determine why my tank lid did not fit properly. I grew up the son of a plumber and worked in my fathers business for years and installed a lot of toilets - this lid did not sit on the tank properly...cover the front edge and the back edge showed - cover the back edge and the front edge showed. Checked the parts list, and tank and lid numbers matched. Lee in the Lumberton store was overly gracious (and trusting) and gave me a different number tank and lid for me to try. I had to remove the supplied tank and reinstall the different tank. (No tools required.) Tank and lid now fit and looked right. How does a manufacturer send out a product that offers needless frustration like this? But a deeper frustration set in when i was ready to operate the toilet. I hit the flush lever and released it - like everyone in America is used to doing. The flapper came up and immediately closed back. No bowl flush at all. Thus ensued a quest on the internet to find some instructions for the fluidmaster 540 flapper operation. The site offered by Am Std was for the fill valve only..no good. I finally found a help site that reviewed how to adjust the flapper by rotating the clear bulb. It comes set on 1 but needs to be set on 10. Why would a manufacturer send out a product intentionally set not to operate properly? A word of caution on the adjustment of the flapper (which you will find no information about on fluidmaster or am std sites)--do not attempt to rotate the clear bulb in position - you'll break off all the setting tabs. Remove the bulb by depressing the two extruded tabs with a small screwdriver to release the bulb. Pull it straight out and then reinsert it to the 10 setting. My toilet now flushes properly with just a push of the lever and release. I was 10 minutes away from boxing the whole thing up and returning it for a Kohler. Too much manufacturer frustration for something as basically simple as a toilet. Now I still have another return trip to the store to return the first tank and lid.",3,55,18,Negative

I had to cart it up to a 2nd floor location but by taking the bowl and tank separately it was not that difficult. I can see how it could be excessively heavy for some but not more so than other toilets I have toted. Installation took me about 1/2 hour--very straightforward. I saw some comments to the effect that installing the tank was tricky and took 2 people. I had no problem doing it by my self. My only complaint is the flush. I saw the flush rating was ""4 to 5--best"". The flush on this unit is significantly weaker than the other toilets in my house but those toilets are older, 1.6 gallons per flush compared to the 1.28 gallons per flush of this unit.

119,121,0.027252506,0.09757955,0.8751679,"I had a Cadet 3 toilet installed about three years ago in one of our three bathrooms and have been very pleased with its operation and cleanliness. (I think it was a 1.6 GPF model.) Last week I had two of the 1.28 GPF ""Saver"" models installed in the other bathrooms, thinking they would be just as satisfactory since the advertised features and appearance were the same. Well, not quite. Stuff ejected under high gas pressure does stick to the back of the toilet despite the ""Power Wash"" and ""Ever Clean"" bowl surface. (However, a stream of water from an adjacent shower hose immediately removes it.) This is my only disappointment. In an attempt to improve performance I used the adjustment screw in the tank to raise the water level to the maximum. Then, after reading the review by ""plumbingsemipro"" (November 11, 2012) and following his helpful instructions, I adjusted the flapper, which was set on 8, to the number 10 setting. These adjustments have a marginal effect and probably increased the GPF to about 1.5. Nevertheless, the most effective operational tip is to hold the handle down for a full three seconds to fully drain the tank - and then use a shower hose when necessary. (I have an idea that the round bowl model would be less likely to have this problem but the elongated bowl is what everyone wants for seating comfort.) As for the cheap toilet seat, when I first tried each toilet, I noted a sharp square edge on the underside of the seat pressing into my flesh. A few minutes with a fine grade sanding block rounded the edges sufficiently for reasonable comfort. Yes, the lid does buckle when I sit on it (185 lbs) but the depression is comfortable and it shows no signs of cracking. So, for the time being I will save the $40 or more per seat to replace them and continue to use them. I did purchase a better grade wax ring, to be on the safe side, and the water inlet connection line for each toilet. Since I live in Florida I opted to have them installed to avoid paying sales tax on the merchandise. That, along with Lowe's 40% discount on the second installation, brought the net installation cost per toilet to $65. Something you might want to consider under similar circumstances if you don't want to wrestle with heavy crockery and want the installation to be fast and guaranteed.",4,4,0,Positive

I head a friend that showed up and said he would help me so it would be even faster I thought. Again WRONG!!!! First it was late when we got home about an hour and a half before Lowe's closed for the night. Instead of unpacking the new toilet and checking to make sure everything was there while I was lugging the old one out my friend just pulled everything out of the box and had it just setting there when I came back in. Now I have installed toilets many times when I use to remodel homes, so getting the old wax ring up and the new one down and the bolts to secure the toilet didn't take long. Now when it came to installing the tank on the back. We couldn't find the nuts that went on the pre installed bolts in the tank. I went back to the box and looked in every piece of folded cardboard just to see if he had just over looked them,not the case. So now I drive all the way back to Lowe's to get the nuts. The gentleman that helped us has very nice and just gave us the nuts and the nifty little plastic holder that was supposed to come with mine. Drive all the way home and now I'm ready to do this. I looked at the doughnut gasket that goes between the tank and the bowl and it seemed a little small to me but it has been awhile since I had had to do this so I figured that it was just smaller so it would be a perfect fit and cut down on cost. WRONG!!! I couldn't get it to stay on and now I'm feeling like a fool because I can't get something so simple to work. Finally I got it to stay on long enough to bolt it down. Success I thought. Wrong when I flushed it I flooded my bathroom! Now it's too late to go back because Lowe's is now closed. Thank GOD we have 2 bathrooms in our home is all I can say. As soon as the doors opened the next morning I was there again the same gentlemen that had helped the night before was a little shocked to see me standing there. When he asked ""well did you get it all taken care of last night?"" I handed home the donut gasket and ask if maybe he could show me how that was supposed to fit. We walked back to the same box he had opened the night before and pulled out the donut gasket from that box. As he shook his head he said he had never seen so many things go wrong with one toilet ever. When I got home put the new donut gasket on and it NOW works like a charm. It's a great toilet if you get all the parts you need. Oh yeah I also tried calling the 1-800 number for help when I was first trying to get the donut gasket to fit it was too late and the call center was closed.

I spent hours researching toilets before my purchase. Every aspect of this toilet is exactly what I was looking for. It has a powerful flush, an elongated bowl, a classic design and it takes up less floorspace than the Kohler round bowl from 2012 it replaced. This American Standard toilet looks nicer, flushes better and has the aforementioned elongated bowl! This is an excellent toilet for the price. I'm impressed with the quality of the parts. Many toilets I looked at had parts made in China. The tank and bowl on this toilet are made in Mexico. The inner workings of the tank are quality Fluidmaster parts. Major home improvement stores carry Fluidmaster replacement parts. As for the seat, it's what I expected. It is a standard plastic seat and it's not uncomfortable. It can always be replaced with with one that better suits you but this seat suits me just fine. Everything needed for installation is in the box including brass floor bolts, a wax ring and simple instructions with just a few steps and detailed illustrations. I installed it in less than an hour by myself. Again, I am very pleased with my purchase.",5,0,0,Neutral
