It was designed for a 12 inch rough-in flange distance, and the seat was taller than the standard height it was replacing, while being a standard round design. Everything needed to install the toilet, including a thicker than average wax ring, flange bolts, and even the bolt covers were in a kit in the box. The tank was separate, but assembly was easy. The full poster instruction sheet was handy, and while instructions were included to adjust the water level in the tank, it was already calibrated very well. It appears to be well built, and with American Standard's 5 year complete warrantee there is peace of mind when it comes to holding up well.

I removed the Fill Valve and determined the model 300 height is not adjustable. Also, the Flush Valve (overflow valve) is too short preventing any additional water from being added to the tank. Went to Lowes and explained the problem and we pulled a Mainstream from the shelf and verified the water level would be low due to the Fill valve and short overflow valve limitations.

The flush is way more quiet than my old toilet and the tank obviously is quicker to fill up since it uses less water. I'm short and tend to be vertically challenged. It wasn't an issue to buy the comfort height toilet. I'm use to sitting on higher toilets. But the toilet seat I have an issue with and that's why I give this 4 stars. I had read previous reviews where people said they didn't use the toilet seat that came with the box but none had really elaborated as to why. Well, I will. The seat has a very small opening which measures 8-1/2x10. So, when you sit down your bum feels like it's being suctioned through the opening. Then there's the angle to the seat where it curves inward. Hence, my feet dangle and I can't sit comfortably on the toilet and then I tend to urinate over my bum which usually isn't an issue. This princess doesn't like wetting herself and will be replacing the seat with a flatter more wide seat to avoid this over spray.

It wasn't cheap. #2~Inside the tank lid says' Made in Mexico' and the lid/seat is of CHEAP GRADE PLASTIC. I am in my old age of 84 and I have NEVER bought or had a plastic lid/seat. I hate it. #3~It (the commode) rocked after it was installed and the installer said my floor was not level and I used a wedge under it. It still wasn't stationery. #4~We go to ISTALLER number 2 and he redid the whole job of installing again last week, 7-25. He assured me the problem was not the first installer, but it was how the bottom of the commode was designed. He had to trim or adjust my pipe coming out of the floor, consuming a lot of time, and finally got it to stay solid and not rock. He said he had never seen a commode bottom made like that one. #5~One night I flushed before going to bed and the commode flush ran all night long. I am on well water and septic tank and my yard around the septic tank was flooded the next morning. Glad I have had a lot of rain lately or my well would have been near drained.

The seat is cheapo and uncomfortable, no doubt about it. So is the seal. My plumber went the extra yard and got a better seal. The biggest problem is the flushes are inconsistent. About every 20th flush, the flapper gets caught on the chain and doesn't drop over the hole, causing the water to keep running and running, right down the drain. So much for the water savings, if I don't notice it right away. Consequently, I now have to stand there after every flush and tap the handle after the flush completes to make sure the flapper dropped. That is even after the pull chain length was adjusted to be taut and as short as possible. The chain's design is a bad thing. And about every 50th flush, the darn toilet just decides it doesn't want to completely flush. I have to dump a bucket of water into the bowl to trigger the siphoning action, and thankfully, that always works. It flushes fine after that --until the next time it's tired of flushing.

189,190,0.35696608,0.42414075,0.21889317,"We chose this model to install in our hall bathroom, replacing an older (original?) American Standard toilet that was ready for retirement. We have a 1950s-era 3-bedroom ranch house. It was installed in early January 2018, so we've had about 2 months' service from it. In most respects, it's a great toilet. The flushing mechanism does an amazing job of moving waste out of the bowl with very little water, and with about 99% first-flush reliability. I've only had to plunge the toilet twice, and both were easy jobs. Having said all of the above, if we had it to do all over again, I would probably look for a different toilet for this particular bathroom. Reason: this toilet has three inherent ""ick"" problems. I think it'd be a great option for bathrooms in out-of-the-way places, like a furnished basement, or places where a high standard of cleanliness isn't really expected, like an outbuilding or a lake cabin. But for a high-traffic area in your home, such as a half bathroom (aka a ""powder room"") in your downstairs living area, this is probably not a great choice. Here are the three ""ick factors"" I mentioned -- read at your own risk... The small amount of water in the bowl means that poo can pile up so high that some of it rises above the water line, and really puts a stink to the air. The small amount of water that enters the bowl is not enough to really flush the walls of the bowl and get them clean. So poo that gets on the wall of the bowl has to be brushed away. The small amount of water that enters the bowl is not enough to completely flush away ALL remnants of the previous bowl's ""load."" So, to keep the toilet looking presentable, it sometimes has to be flushed twice. Needless to say, this works against the water conservation ideal that the toilet is supposed to promote.",3,4,0,Neutral

I put the tank on after seating the toilet base which made it lighter to put in place. After replacing the bolts I put the wax free seal over the drain. It has bolt holes that come through the seal. This made it easier to place the base on the screws. The new seal instructions tells you how many bands to put over the drain based on where the flange is in relation to the floor. Mine was slightly below the floor so I used two bands on my installation. The base was above the floor before installing the nuts on the bolts. It settled nicely against the floor as I tightened the bolts. You can feel it when the base is solidly on the floor as you turn the nuts. I adjusted the filler valve to stop about 1/2 inch below the overflow pipe. I replaced the flexible line from the cut off valve and the toilet tank since the toilet is higher than the old unit.

I naively thought ""white is white"". It is not. But that's not a deal-breaker, just disappointing. 2. The 16"" height I assumed was also a standard thing, but it turns out the Kohler units we had were 14"" and how shall I say it? They were more comfortable. We are not short people, either. If you play in the NBA, maybe 16"" is what you want. I've never noticed a toilet this high anywhere else, ever, and I almost want to buy new toilets just to go back to 14"". Maybe I'm weird, but the bottom line is: MEASURE YOUR CURRENT TOILET SEAT HEIGHT FIRST and if you like it, stick with it.

This being said we paid extra and had both toilets professionally installed by a local plumber contracted through Lowe's. The plumber did a wonderful job and we have not had any issues with the water level filling correctly. In fact when we flush either of the toilets they flush very well, fill very quickly and to the correct water level each time. We do not find them noisy at all. In fact our old toilets were much louder than these when filling. The seat provided is, in our opinion, just fine. It does not move and is just fine. Again, put on and tightened down by the plumber who did our installation. It is true that the seats are not the ""best"" but it is a toilet after all.

When flushed at night, it would awaken either of us that was sleep, so we were looking for a bowl that would be quiet when flushed and refilling. This one worked out great! We can now use the potty at night and not wake the other. It's just a quick, not too loud, Swoosh sound and it's over. The only thing I do not like about the toilet is the height. I thought the right height would be great after having a standard height toilet. But I've since realized that standard height is better for me because I'm only 5' 3"". The right height does not allow the proper positioning for bowel movements when you're that short, so I have to resort to using a squatty potty when I use the potty in our master bath. But overall it's a great Bowl. Most times it's flushes completely, but occasionally I've got to double flush. The toilet seat is a little flimsy but, I do like the way it closes slowly and quietly.
