I did not remove them before installation and wish I had. You need a razor blade to get all the adhesive off. 2) The seat that comes with it is loose, not ridiculously so, but enough to be annoying. It will be replaced soon. 3) ""Water-saving toilets"". I'll never be convinced that the vol...",4,8,2,Negative

I thought this was going to be a great product not so much here now I am out $150 because of a manufacture defect. do not purchase this item spend more to get a better product",1,5,7,Negative

Easy install, flushes great, easy to clean, good looking toilet (I'm partial to the square front base rather than round/oval). My only complaint, since under the Project Source name, is the damned ""complies with..."" stickers placed on the tank & bowl that are so hard to remove. I spent more time removing those than placing & securing the actual toilet!",5,1,0,Positive

6,7,0.07438908,0.13648914,0.7891218,"had to replace a 1 year old toilet, so I was looking for a better quality toilet. I read 100s of bad reviews. most of which were from missing parts, damaged merchandise, or complaints about cheap seats. this review could easily have been bad if I used that metric. the first one I picked up was damaged. I discovered this because I was meticulously was checking everything, cracks, loose bolts, and for anything that might cause a problem with my installation. had I checked it out a little bit before I left the store, I wouldn't have had to make a 2nd trip. the second one one was perfect, installation was a breeze and it flushed fabulous, however when flushed only half the water escapes before the flap closes. this however is plenty of water and flush normal daily duty stuff. the awesome part is that if you need to, you could hold down the handle and get a super flush. all the guts inside are standard on the shelf items, which is why I couldn't just fix my old one. so that's awesome. lastly the seat....it was given for free, and as they say you get what you pay for, so if you want a nice seat buy one, this one is just fine for me. bottom line LOVE THIS TOILET.!!!",5,5,0,Positive

15,16,0.74062777,0.22874734,0.030624911,Purchased this toilet and installed only to find it leaks. Took it apart and found both tank bolts loose. Put it back together still leaked. Found the huge main nut holding the tank seal was also loose. 2 days and several times back apart we are finally able to use it. All the loose hardware was installed by the manufacturer.
