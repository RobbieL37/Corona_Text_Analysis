Everything I needed was included except for your water supply hose which I replaced along with a new water shutoff valve . Once I got the old toilet out it was fairly simple to install. Read your directions before you do anything and check that you have all the necessary tools and parts to complete the installation. I was finished installing in about 90 minutes. Make sure you check for leaks. My new toilet works great and is very quiet when filling up. Very modern looking and has a slow closing lid which works very smoothly. I highly recommend this American Standard toilet. I only use American Standard toilets because they are very dependable and never disappoint me !!!,5

He found it easy to install that took about an hour. He liked the mechanism on the inside of the toilet. The blue water in the initial tank fill aided just in case there was a leak, which there wasn't. Instructions were clear and concise. The elongated shape gives the extra comfort everyone expects. Thankful a quality toilet seat was included. The flush has excellent water pressure to clear the bowl. The only reason for a four star is the color of the tank appears to be a darker color than the tank lid and toilet base. My other family members did need see the color difference, but judge for yourself in the pictures. Otherwise, a quality and perfectly functioning toilet.",4

It took about an hour including some necessary floor prep. It comes in three pieces - the base, the tank, and the seat. It's very easy to assemble. Two nuts and bolts and wax ring (included) to mount base to floor. Two nuts and bolts and rubber seal (included) to mount tank to base. Two nuts and bolts (also included) to mount seat to base. After connecting the water supply hose and turning the water on, I noticed it was quieter and a quicker refill than the previous toilet. Note: I needed a 12"" supply hose (which I had) instead of the old 9"" one. Be careful trimming the base mounting bolts - I recommend a small to medium pair of bolt cutters. I didn't need to adjust the water level, but the instructions explain how to do it. I'm very pleased with the new toilet.",5

The installation went very smoothly all I needed was provided with the toilet including a new wax seal. The instruction were clear and easy to follow. Accessing and tightening the nuts connecting the tank to the toilet was a bit tricky but not too bad. Overall a very easy installation. The new toilet is now easier to clean, quieter and uses less water for what appears to be a better flush. So I am very happy with the final installation. The most difficult part was removing the old toilet as the previous installation used a lot of caulk around the toilet and I had to force a chisel under the old toilet. Once this was removed everything associated with the new installation went smoothly.",4

The instructions do mention this so follow the directions and you will be fine. I waited 2 weeks to write this review to ensure the toilet works as advertised and to determine if it leaks like some reviews mentioned. I haven't had any issues at all and it flushes very well. Perhaps the leaks are a consequence of not following the instructions carefully and the toilet not being installed properly. I'm very happy with this toilet and the way it looks. It comes with everything you need except the supply line. I used the 12 inch supply line and although it comes with a wax ring, I used a thicker one that has a 5 year warranty.",5

The box this came in was a little beat up but the toilet was in perfect condition. It was fairly easy for 1 person to replace the old toilet with this. Make sure you turn off the water before you unhook the hoses. Almost forgot that step. This does come with wax ring so you don't have to buy one of those. Be careful setting it over the bolts that should already be coming out of the floor. If you hit it wrong you could break the toilet base. I recommend 2 people to put it in place if you have room to maneuver it. I like that it has a smaller tank. Takes up less room so I can fit a narrow cabinet next to it against the wall to hold cleaning wipes, trash bags, etc. The handle is a pretty shiny chrome and in the front not the side. I like that better. Easier to spray with disinfectant when cleaning. It comes with a toilet seat that goes slow as it auto closes. But you do have to sort of start the motion or it won't lower by itself. Might be a cool feature if people actually do close the seat/lids on toilet. It sits really nice in the small area it's in. I have an elongated in my bathroom and wanted the same size in the boys bathroom so they'll stop using mine since they like my larger one better. So far no complaints on this elongated one. Now if I can just get them to keep it clean.",5

The flush performance is surprisingly good for a 2 inch opening from tank to bowl. The description says the PowerWash rim scrubs the bowl clean with every flush. Sadly, I did not find that to be the case. Out of the box there was some small debris in the toilet bowl. Upon installing, I flushed three times and some of that debris on the side of the bowl did not budge. I had to gently swipe it with a piece of toilet paper to get it off the bowl. Based on this, the bowl scrubbing action of PowerFlush is not working as advertised on my unit. My other complaint is with the marketing that says the trapway is fully glazed. Looking into the trapway from underneath the toilet where waste will eject into the drain shows it is not glazed and the surface is rough. Perhaps this is a defect in my unit but if you are going to market this as a feature, every toilet should be checked to ensure it was properly glazed before it is boxed for shipping. I also found the underside of the rim where water exits to clean the bowl is not glazed. By having a rough and porous surface here, it invites mold growth. My particular model is standard height (15 inches) with a 12 inch rough in and the elongated bowl. My installation location is a 10 inch rough in. I did a lot of measuring to ensure the toilet would fit so I decided to install it in the 10 inch location. After installation there was a 1/4 inch gap between the tank and the wall which was acceptable for me. After a few days of use, no clogs and no need to hold the handle down during the flush cycle to force more water out of the tank during the flush. The toilet has a nice look and the slow close plastic seat is wonderful. I experienced no leaks after installation. While the toilet is working well after a few days of use, I cannot recommend it because the selling features of PowerScrub and a fully glazed trapway are not true for the unit I received.",3

The old toilet had a good flush but couldn’t flush a lot because the size of the opening on the bottom. This toilet uses less water but flushed way more. I tried flushing 8 large wads of toilet paper like my son usually ends up doing and it flushed just fine. Installation was super simple, everything worked great first time with no leaks. Compact design works great for smaller bathrooms and children. My wife wanted this in our bathroom but I installed it in our sons bathroom because he is most likely to clog a toilet and it will be much harder now. I would definitely recommend.",5

Should last a good while.",WithReviews,"May 23, 2022","When grandma has to use the plunger on your toilet, it might be a sign your old toilet needs to be replaced. Embarrassingly, my old toilet fit this description; it was not really a strong flusher and could easily get clogged. This American Standard toilet is not going to blow you away with any bells and whistles, but it does what it says it’ll do, and it does it well. I have not put it to the ultimate “gallon of golf balls” equivalent test yet, but it has easily handled what I’ve thrown at it, and I like how it looks in our bathroom. The internal hardware is your bare bones toilet accoutrement; no fancy dual flush or anything that will break easily or be hard to maintain when it does, which is good for long term maintenance. No proprietary parts that will cost 2x the generic stuff either. At just 1.28 gallons per flush, it’s pretty efficient even without the “dual flush” function other toilets have anyway. Everything needed to complete the install came with the toilet (minus the tools and perhaps a caulk sealer for the bottom, but that’s expected), so install was pretty simple as well. I did find a small blemish in the porcelain of the toilet bowl, but I don’t notice it unless I’m close to the toilet bowl to clean it. Getting super nit-picky, the seat itself might be a bit warped; one side does not lay perfectly flat on the porcelain ledge when the other side is. Speaking of the seat, it is fairly comfortable to sit in. It does not have a quick release function to help with cleaning around the hinge area, though, which would’ve been nice to have. I like that the bowl doesn’t have any extra “levels” and is smooth all around. Each flush sends a flow of water all around the toilet bowl to keep things fairly clean, and I like that the bowl has a decent level of water in it to hopefully catch stuff without leaving any…uh, skid marks. Overall, this toilet should be easy to clean and hopefully not require cleaning as often. The flush and tank refill are also pretty quiet, which is nice. Overall, I think this is a great toilet that should last many years. I have one other toilet that is about the same age as my old one that this replaced, so while I want to take a few more weeks to put this thing through its paces, this is definitely a strong candidate to replace that toilet as well.",4

Nice features to have out of the box. Everything you need to install comes with it in the packaging, so it is pretty much ready to go, again, out of the box. Pressure for flushing seems to be highly optimized and does flush with with what seems to be higher and more consistent pressure. At I.28 gpf it counts as water saving since most toilets after ‘94 have 1.6gpf or higher. So this will go a long way to save water. I especially love the slow close plastic seat. I always replace the standard seats with slow close plastic ones, and I find them to be more comfortable. So it’s nice that a toilet finally comes packed with one. Valve is pre installed, it’s a two piece setup so just bolt on the tank, put wax ring on, and finish up. All instructions included. Very nice, very efficient toilet.

While still only using 1.28 gallons per flush they flush with much more pressure and do not get clogged nearly as much. Plus that pressure helps keep the toilet itself looking cleaner. We really like this toilet and would recommend it to anyone. The only short fall of this toilet and most new toilets sold today is it comes with a very light weight plastic seat. I bought and use a much sturdier soft close seat. They don’t cost much and can be found at Home Depot.,5
