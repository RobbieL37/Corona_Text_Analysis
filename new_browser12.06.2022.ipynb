I paid $100 for this toilet and had someone else install it but I normally install them myself. I had the Fluidmaster waxless seal which work great. this toilet has quality features usually seen in toilets twice to three times the price. first of all it has a 3 inch flush valve and a fully glazed 2 in trapway. the fill valve is a Fluidmaster which is the top of the line. the flapper appears to be just a standard 3 inch flapper. when comes to replacing it I'm going to use a Fluidmaster which has a silicone seat on it and a hard plastic frame. I measured the water spot which is slightly smaller than the American Standard get three I measured 8 in or slightly above front to back. my complaints about the total Drake is that it has more skid marks and not as good a wash down as some of the ever brands. I think American Standard has a little better wash down. both Americans standard and Toto have special treatments on the glazing inside the bowl. I have found that the project Source toilet flushes in my opinion as strongly as a total Drake and possibly stronger than the Cadet 3. I think it's washed down it's about similar to both of those or possibly better than the total Drake. the total Drake and the American Standard are advertisers having special extra smooth glaze within the bowl. that was not an advertised specialty of this toilet but I did not notice much difference. Some things I point out as negative. 1) the siphon trap has a kink in it compared to the American Standard check my picture out. 2)the tank to bowl bolts appear to be brass plated Steel. when buying it I would buy some solid brass or stainless steel tank to bowl bolts. 3)the water spot is slightly smaller than the American Standard Cadet 3 but I felt that the wash down is just as good or better than the Cadet 3 and definitely better than the total drake. overall a great value. I highly recommend it. see my photos. #1. water spot size 8 in. #2 trapway has a kink in it not straight like the American Standard possibly a source of Clogs. #3 picture of the fill valve and flush valve inside the tank appears to be Fluidmaster fill valve and a very nice 3 in flush valve.\"},\n",

Then attach the water line (not included).

No leaks, which was amazing to me... no slow leaks into the bowl, no leaks around the tank.

       "  'review': \"I had this toilet for over a month waiting for work to be done. Once I unpacked it, I was extremely impressed in the packaging. The insides of the toilet were already installed so all I had to do was attach the wax ring (included), bolt the toilet to the floor (bolts are included), and then bolt the tank to the toilet (also already included). Then attach the water line (not included). The tank already had the flapper and the water installed along with the tank bolts fastened so there was nothing to do but turn the water on and check for leaks. No leaks, which was amazing to me... no slow leaks into the bowl, no leaks around the tank. It's been a long time since I've purchased a toilet so having all this prefab work done already took a 2 hour job down to 30 minutes.\"}]"
