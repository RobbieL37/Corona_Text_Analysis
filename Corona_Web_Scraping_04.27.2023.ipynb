First remove the old toilet only to find the flange is destroyed and will take ingenuity and lots of work. Many hours later I have the new flange and wax ring (provided with this toilet) in place ready for installation. This toilet bolted in very easily but I had to use plastic connector bolt different from the ones provided. These were recommended by a plumber when I was addressing the broken flange issue. I went to connect the toilet to the water supply but alas they did not provide that water line. Trying to reuse the old one it broke because part of it was plastic. It took three trips to Lowe’s to get the correct new shut-off valve and water fill line. Mostly my fault for not trying the connection at the store. The best part of this whole installation was the toilet itself, in the past I would have had to install the guts of the toilet myself adding time and expense. While this is only the third toilet I have ever installed it was by far the easiest. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to install a new toilet. I did spend a bit of time hunting for the plastic bolts for the seat, and finally decided to use the old ones figuring that they were not shipped or that I had misplaced them. After the new seat was installed I lifted the lid to conduct a test flush only to find the new plastic bolts taped conveniently to the underside of the lid.</td>\n",

I had previously installed three other toilets in other bathrooms in the house. This toilet was the easiest to install, but that is largely because there weren't any issues with the flange or flooring flatness (no shims required) like in the other rooms. The kit contained everything I needed. Sometimes if things aren't so square, you'll need shims to level the toilet and possibly a problem-solver seal, rather than the supplied wax ring. The only non-obvious part of the install was the plastic rings that hold the plastic dome caps that cover the mounting bolts for the bottom portion of the toilet. I had to put on my glasses to see that they are marked with \"this side up\" text. As a tip, I used some tools on the floor as guides as to where the flange bolts were as I lowered the base down onto the flange seal. I have included a photos of what I'm speaking of for clarity. The longest part of the install was cleaning around the area, which is typical in my experience. The flush works well, but not quite as powerful as a toilet costing three times as much. For the pool room, this will be just fine.</td>\n",

That said, a few things to keep in mind: 1. Buy an extra wax ring. If you’ve had a remodel that includes granite or marble flooring, odds are good the supplied ring won’t be thick enough to create a good seal. Having a second ring will allow you to double the depth. Wax rings run about $2.00, so go ahead and splurge—it could save you a trip back to the store; 2. When attaching the tank, you’ll need to stretch the rubber gasket a bit to seat it flush to the bottom of the tank. The instructions are a bit vague on that, and you’ll be going through a couple of towels if you don’t! The toilet itself is pretty good. The oblong shape is far more comfortable than traditional round bowls. A quick flick of the handle drains about half the tank (thereby conserving water) and holding the handle down will completely drain it (for when a little more oomph is needed). What I like best is that the tank is very quiet when refilling. All said, a good product that’s easy to install.</td>\n",

That's what I need it to do and it does it well. Waste goes away when I hit flush...that's a win. For install, it went smoothly. Removed the old toilet, cleaned the old wax off the flange, then began installing the new toilet. I only have one criticism...the hardware kit that comes with the toilet doesn't have the nice little plastic washers to help hold the flange bolts up while you install the bowl. You can see in pic #3 where I used small pieces of cardboard to hold the bolts up. It works, but it wouldn't be too much to ask for Mansfield to include simple, cheap, thin plastic washers to hold the bolts up. Other than that, install was smooth. Got the bowl installed then put the tank on the back. After that, I connected the water feed, turned on the water, and checked for leaks...there were none! It was a smooth install and the toilet does exactly what a toilet should. The waste goes away and I know I have a quality toilet that is going to last!</td>\n",

All bolts, nuts and gaskets, including new seat, hardware, wax ring, flange bolts and caps are all in the box. Installation time including taking out the old toilet was less than an hour. After Installation, I turned on the water and the float was even set to the right water level. I am happy with this product and would highly recommend.</td>\n",

The toilet has a large jet at the bottom that helps push waste to the drain (see photo). THE NEUTRAL: The flapper has a unique design as the hole on one side is larger than the hole on the other side. Not a big deal as Lowe's sells the Mansfield flapper (item # 4133941). If you care to upgrade to a better flapper, you will greatly increase your flush performance (Lowe's item # 4133941), see photo. The Fluid Master fill valve comes with a flow restrictor which means that it takes a long time to refill the tank after each flush. Instructions for removing the flow restrictor can be found my Googling \"How to remove the toilet fill valve regulator.\" COULD BE BETTER: There are no rubber washers or spacers used to level &amp; support the tank as you secure it to the toilet. After failing to get a good seal, I placed 3 tank toilet washers on top of each of the 3 holes on the toilet, then I placed the tank on the toilet (see photo). The Lowe's item # on the tank washers is 3625389. The tank was immediately level and stable, and the seal was perfect. Overall the Mansfield toilet is a quality product at a good price. If you add the rubber tank washers as spacers, you don't have to worry about porcelain to porcelain contact as the tank to toilet washer is compressed by the weight of the water in the tank. As stated, you can upgrade to the other brand flapper and greatly improve your flush performance.</td>\n",

The hardware, toilet seat and flush lever handle are pretty flimsy plastic but easy to replace. The bolt cap covers are not deep enough to snap over the bolt. I used an extra think wax ring but maybe i should have doubled up instead. Not sure if that would help but minor issue.

Wasn't looking forward to the job, but this Mansfield Pro-Fit Standard Height was really easy to install. It came with everything you need to finish the job. No need to go back to the store (as usual) to get parts that you don't have. The attachment screws, nuts, etc. worked well. Especially appreciated the ease of attached the top section.

       "1   The \"Pro-Fit White WaterSense Round Standard Height 2-Piece Toilet 12-in Rough-In Size\" is made in China. T he box has all the instructions clearly printed on it plus an \"Installation Guide book\" inside. The only problem I had was securing the Tank to Bowel, the first time did exactly what the instructions said and it leaked badly. Problem is the Rubber Head Bolts did not properly seal. Pulled it apart and applied Sealant to Rubber bolt heads and followed instructions as per book. This time it sealed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "2   Let me preface this article with how much I despise plumbing projects. This one was no exception, what should have been a two hour project took almost three times as long. First remove the old toilet only to find the flange is destroyed and will take ingenuity and lots of work. Many hours later I have the new flange and wax ring (provided with this toilet) in place ready for installation. This toilet bolted in very easily but I had to use plastic connector bolt different from the ones provided. These were recommended by a plumber when I was addressing the broken flange issue. I went to connect the toilet to the water supply but alas they did not provide that water line. Trying to reuse the old one it broke because part of it was plastic. It took three trips to Lowe’s to get the correct new shut-off valve and water fill line. Mostly my fault for not trying the connection at the store. The best part of this whole installation was the toilet itself, in the past I would have had to install the guts of the toilet myself adding time and expense. While this is only the third toilet I have ever installed it was by far the easiest. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to install a new toilet. I did spend a bit of time hunting for the plastic bolts for the seat, and finally decided to use the old ones figuring that they were not shipped or that I had misplaced them. After the new seat was installed I lifted the lid to conduct a test flush only to find the new plastic bolts taped conveniently to the underside of the lid.   \n",
       "3   I installed this new toilet in my pool room. The original toilet was 38 years old and a high-water-use type toilet. I had previously installed three other toilets in other bathrooms in the house. This toilet was the easiest to install, but that is largely because there weren't any issues with the flange or flooring flatness (no shims required) like in the other rooms. The kit contained everything I needed. Sometimes if things aren't so square, you'll need shims to level the toilet and possibly a problem-solver seal, rather than the supplied wax ring. The only non-obvious part of the install was the plastic rings that hold the plastic dome caps that cover the mounting bolts for the bottom portion of the toilet. I had to put on my glasses to see that they are marked with \"this side up\" text. As a tip, I used some tools on the floor as guides as to where the flange bolts were as I lowered the base down onto the flange seal. I have included a photos of what I'm speaking of for clarity. The longest part of the install was cleaning around the area, which is typical in my experience. The flush works well, but not quite as powerful as a toilet costing three times as much. For the pool room, this will be just fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4   Kind of hard to get excited about a toilet, but the install on this was a breeze. Instructions were simple and the rubber-headed tank bolts create a great seal. That said, a few things to keep in mind: 1. Buy an extra wax ring. If you’ve had a remodel that includes granite or marble flooring, odds are good the supplied ring won’t be thick enough to create a good seal. Having a second ring will allow you to double the depth. Wax rings run about $2.00, so go ahead and splurge—it could save you a trip back to the store; 2. When attaching the tank, you’ll need to stretch the rubber gasket a bit to seat it flush to the bottom of the tank. The instructions are a bit vague on that, and you’ll be going through a couple of towels if you don’t! The toilet itself is pretty good. The oblong shape is far more comfortable than traditional round bowls. A quick flick of the handle drains about half the tank (thereby conserving water) and holding the handle down will completely drain it (for when a little more oomph is needed). What I like best is that the tank is very quiet when refilling. All said, a good product that’s easy to install.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "5   We installed this toilet to replace the chair height one that was in our spare bath when we got the house. The chair height is just too high in a bathroom used primarily by our younger kids (6+). Overall, this toilet is a toilet. I hit the flush lever and it flushes. That's what I need it to do and it does it well. Waste goes away when I hit flush...that's a win. For install, it went smoothly. Removed the old toilet, cleaned the old wax off the flange, then began installing the new toilet. I only have one criticism...the hardware kit that comes with the toilet doesn't have the nice little plastic washers to help hold the flange bolts up while you install the bowl. You can see in pic #3 where I used small pieces of cardboard to hold the bolts up. It works, but it wouldn't be too much to ask for Mansfield to include simple, cheap, thin plastic washers to hold the bolts up. Other than that, install was smooth. Got the bowl installed then put the tank on the back. After that, I connected the water feed, turned on the water, and checked for leaks...there were none! It was a smooth install and the toilet does exactly what a toilet should. The waste goes away and I know I have a quality toilet that is going to last!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "6   This is a nice looking, fairly easy to assemble toilet. It works well and comes with everything needed for installation and use except the toilet supply line (most toilets don't include that). Flushing pressure is very good but not great. It could be a little better. This toilet also sits pretty low. I am not sure if there is a higher / chair height available. Everything else is pretty standard and fits well. On the back of the tank lid there is a sticker with the names and serial numbers for all replacement parts which I have not seen on a toilet before and is a smart addition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "7   First off, the toilet had easy to read instructions in the box and on the box. Installation was very straight forward. The instructions said to tighten the three tank bolts two turns past hand tight. I did hand tight believing it was enough, but it seeped some. I did the two turns as called for and problem solved. The elongated design looks really good and sits quite comfortably. The tank plumbing worked great and no adjustment was needed. The seat was also an easy install. The flush is robust and cleans the bowl well. All the necessary hardware was included. The only downside is that the height seemed a little low for me; but I'm 6'5 tall. All in all, a very nice toilet that was easy to install, looks great good and works well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8   This is a Mansfield, ceramic, water efficient toilet. Easy install. One socket and a screwdriver is all I needed. Everything I needed for a toilet swap, was in the box. All bolts, nuts and gaskets, including new seat, hardware, wax ring, flange bolts and caps are all in the box. Installation time including taking out the old toilet was less than an hour. After Installation, I turned on the water and the float was even set to the right water level.

       "9   This toilet looks great. Bright white in color and fits small bathroom well. Install was easy and as long as you take your time, should go in right on the first attempt.

       "10  This toilet came with everything needed and ready to go. The tank is smaller so less water waste. The bowl is smooth and will be easy to clean. In stall was quick and easy came with everything needed except new water line. The plastic seat and lid seem a little to commercial so I will be replacing that. Comes with bees wax gasket to seal toilet to the flange in the floor. This toilet bowl has three holes at the tank attachment be careful not to over tighten here or were it mounts to the floor because it is Ceramic glass and will break if you apply too much torque pressure on the bolts and nuts. So be careful! All and all though this is a great toilet flushes good and is clean and white. I would recommend this product to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "12  Product was shipped to me directly from the factory. They called me and set up delivery. On the day of the delivery the driver called and gave me a 30 minute heads up, worked out great.

       "13  I got tired of my 80s American Standard \"quiet flush\" toilet with its embarassing useless flush. Every bathroom time was frought with anxiety. Sometimes having to fetch a bucket of water to finish the job. Enter the Mansfield Pro-Fit 1. With its American made fully glazed siphon assist trap, this toilet will handle even the largest jobs with ease! Comes with every nut, bolt, seal and fastener required for installation. For the price of a mediocre night out you can also have this confidence inspiring flush in your life. Buy Mansfield and there'll be no regrets!

       "14  THE GOOD: Nice looking, good price, Fluid Master fill valve, toilet tank wax seal & hardware is included. The toilet has a large jet at the bottom that helps push waste to the drain (see photo). THE NEUTRAL: The flapper has a unique design as the hole on one side is larger than the hole on the other side. Not a big deal as Lowe's sells the Mansfield flapper (item # 4133941). If you care to upgrade to a better flapper, you will greatly increase your flush performance (Lowe's item # 4133941), see photo. The Fluid Master fill valve comes with a flow restrictor which means that it takes a long time to refill the tank after each flush. Instructions for removing the flow restrictor can be found my Googling \"How to remove the toilet fill valve regulator.\" COULD BE BETTER: There are no rubber washers or spacers used to level & support the tank as you secure it to the toilet. After failing to get a good seal, I placed 3 tank toilet washers on top of each of the 3 holes on the toilet, then I placed the tank on the toilet (see photo). The Lowe's item # on the tank washers is 3625389. The tank was immediately level and stable, and the seal was perfect. Overall the Mansfield toilet is a quality product at a good price. If you add the rubber tank washers as spacers, you don't have to worry about porcelain to porcelain contact as the tank to toilet washer is compressed by the weight of the water in the tank. As stated, you can upgrade to the other brand flapper and greatly improve your flush performance.                                               \n",
       "15  I was looking for a no frills toilet to replace my original '80s toilet that used way too much water per flush. I installed a taller toilet in my other bathroom for my daughter who is 4\" taller than me. Needed a lower one for myself. Super easy to install. The hardware, toilet seat and flush lever handle are pretty flimsy plastic but easy to replace. The bolt cap covers are not deep enough to snap over the bolt. I used an extra think wax ring but maybe i should have doubled up instead. Not sure if that would help but minor issue. Good quick flush for #1, hold down for #2...a bonus water saving feature I was not aware of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "16  For a DIY type person this was very easy to install. Having everything needed in the box for install is great. The toilet seat is kind of cheap and thin and doesn't feel overly durable. I'd you've never installed a toilet using the directions in reverse to remove the existing toilet is extremely helpful. The tank bolts having built in gaskets was amazing and made it very easy to seat the tank and not worry that it was going to leak.

       "17  We were finally able to get this thing installed and it took less than 30 minutes to do so. It seems smaller than our previous toilet and it is a normal round rather than the elongated top. I can hear some water now and then, so we'll see if that normalizes by days end. Overall, it's a right on tome replacement for our broken toilet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "18  This is a standard toilet, probably better suited for a smaller bathroom because of it's round bowl design. Easy to hook up. Everything you need is in the box, even the wax ring. Somewhat of a water saver due to it's smaller tank. Just a regular flapper design flush system. Works fine and a good value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "19  Very nice. Quiet flush. Adjustable full valve is a nice feature. I did replace the seat though, simply because I prefer a wooden seat. Great product!
