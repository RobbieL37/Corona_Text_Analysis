All parts were included except the line to connect the commode to the water supply. I purchased brass floor bolts to use instead of the steel ones supplied by the manufacturer, because they are rust-proof and were easier to saw off (both the original and the brass ones were too long). I like the forceful swirl-type flush. Time will tell if it is effective in cleaning the bowl well, but I expect it to. I also like that the toilet seat is a no-slam design. The push-button quick removal design of the toilet seat is also a nice hygienic touch. The old one had a hard to clean area under the hinge section.",5,3,0

It only takes one flush to clear the bowl which is fast and strong. It is easy to install everything is included except a wrench. The redesigned seat is a little tricky but worth the few extra minutes to install. Very simple to remove push a silver button and it lifts off to clean underneath then pop it back on the two pins and your done. When it is in the up position the seat fits into the lid with two little tabs to assist to open or close.,5,3,0

Super high quality with all the parts. The seat is an ingenious idea and works great. The swirl jet gets everything out the first time. The only issue I had on the installation is getting the tank to seal with the bowl. I don’t like the idea of only having the front of the tank come in contact with the bowl. It leaves it open to over tighten the tank and crack it. For that reason I was a leery of over tightening it. Took the tank back off several times to insure it was installed correctly. Everything else went perfectly and easily. Superior product. Very pleased and I’m very fussy ask my wife!!,5,2,0

It feels very premium. It has a flapper style flush valve which should hold up just fine but it's much easier to maintain than the new style. The 2 best features on this toilet are the soft close lid and the lid removal system. If you lift the lid, there's a button you can press to pull the lid off to clean. So nice. There was a manufacturing issue where the gasket on the flush valve was folded over causing a leak, but we were able to get that resolved. Overall a decent toilet; happy with this one.",5,2,0

All waste is removed with one flush. The seat is soft-close and recessed into the lif which is a nice look. The seat also has a quick release button for easy cleaning. The flush is a little louder than other toilets but not terrible. The only negative is that i had to replace the flush valve as the toilet leaked continually.

I notice immediately it was much heavier that the Kol toilet it was replacing. Nothing cheap about it. Guts are standard flowmaster, nothing fancy but solid stuff. Packaged perfect, parts in individual boxes with good instructions. Delivery was delayed but it's holiday time so not a problem. Easy installation for most part. Toilet mount bolts were too short for my tiled floor. Had to purchase 3.5 lag bolts, no big deal. Toilet water bowl is the 2 bolt mount. No issue with leaks, bolted up nice, however still has a little tilt forward so I shimmed tank with small piece of plastic shim to level it out. Toilet seat self closing- First time I ever had to look at instructions to mount a toilet seat! Probably took longer to mount seat that the complete toilet. Didn't help that my wife was watching and wanted it perfectly line up! Very satisfied with this toilet. No leaks, straight forward install. Very quiet operation. Flushes well and cleans up easy. Wife says it looks very high standard compared to contractor grade toilets. Much happier now with the lever flush than the center top lid push button on other toilet.",5,2,0

It seems when you order online, the piece packed for you is the worst piece which they want to get rid off. I tried to run the flush before installation and found that the water jet covered only half of the bowl and left other half dry. I tried many times, filled water to full level in tank and pressed lever down from full to empty, but each time it only covered half of the bowl. I decided it was not for me, as it probably will not clean some solids or liquids which will be in those parts.

My pickup experience was fine. My plumber installed them easily and quickly. I was replacing old, round bowl, low-to-the-floor toilets. I love the elongated bowl and, as a tall person, I especially love the chair height. These toilets have a strong jet rinse and slow-closing seats that do not make a slamming sound. They seem to be easy to keep nice and clean. You do have to hold the flush handle down for a half a second instead of letting go immediately but that's not really an issue.

There is about 3.5 to 4 inches from the rim that doesn’t get cleaned; the water never touches it. I have to manually clean this area after each use; otherwise urine splashes just sit there. It’s a nuisance and looks disgusting. I can’t imagine guests using this toilet. Then there’s this thing with the flushing lever. I don’t understand why it has to be held down for a period of time, for it to flush. Because of this, many will flush in a hurry and not realize they’ve left their business behind, for the next person to clean up. I hope there’s an easy fix to all of this.
